Poorly defined scope of work has been ranked as the one of the highest reasons for poor performance over which owners and construction stakeholders have control. An owner's requirements and expectations are specified during the programming phase of a project and these define a design's scope of work. One focus of Target Value Design (TVD) is making owner's value a primary driver of design by improving project definition during programming-thus optimizing the design phase. While the number of published research articles praising TVD has been increasing, there is a dearth of information regarding the application of architectural programming (AP) to Target Value Design exercises, which engage stakeholders in a design decision making process called Choosing by Advantages (CBA). CBA first requires identification of attributes that are of value to an owner. The purpose of this research was to explore the importance of architectural programming in helping to identify key attributes of value to an owner, and to report on a lean game designed and preliminarily validated by the authors to investigate the accuracy and perception of attribute identification through AP as represented by the game. © 27th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction, IGLC 2019.

The tracking method uses a monocular camera and makes no assumptions on the shape of the terrain or the target motion. The UAV runs two cascaded estimators. The first is an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is responsible for tracking the UAV's state, such as position and velocity relative to a fixed frame. The second estimator is an EKF that is responsible for estimating a fixed number of landmarks within the camera's field of view. Landmarks are parameterized by a quaternion associated with bearing from the camera's optical axis and an inverse distance parameter. The bearing quaternion allows for a minimal representation of each landmark's direction and distance, a filter with no singularities, and a fast update rate due to few trigonometric functions. Three methods for estimating the ground target positions are demonstrated: the first uses the landmark estimator directly on the targets, the second computes the target depth with a weighted average of converged landmark depths, and the third extends the target's measured bearing vector to intersect a ground plane approximated from the landmark estimates. Simulation results show that the third target estimation method yields the most accurate results. © 2017, Institute of Navigation.",,Aircraft detection; Antennas; Cameras; Global positioning system; Inverse problems; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Distance parameter; Minimal representation; Monocular cameras; Multiple grounds; Reference frame; Target estimations; Trigonometric functions; Weighted averages; Extended Kalman filters,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047864637

The tensile pull-out strength of the composite rebar embedded in concrete was measured and compared to steel rebar. Fiberglass/epoxy is less likely to corrode than steel rebar, ensuring more sustainable concrete structures in infrastructure applications. The 0.5"" diameter composite rebar was produced by pulling hundreds of strands of unidirectional fiberglass/epoxy towpreg to form the core of a cylindrical rod. The rods were consolidated by overwrapping strands of aramid fiber under tension in a spiral fashion, and cured using the manufacturer's (TCR Composites) recommended 250¡F cure cycle. Configurations manufactured and tested included tow variations of aramid overwrap (dry and prepreg) with and without sand coating embedded in concrete cubes (8""x8""x8""). The results are compared to baseline values obtained by testing traditional steel rebar and commercially-Available fiberglass composite rebar. The tensile pull-out (bond) strength was quantified using a test fixture in accordance with ACI 440.3R-12. Measurements were collected at both the free and loaded ends of the rebar, with freeend results yielding a more accurate indication of rebar bond stress. The bond strength of the in-house manufactured fiberglass/epoxy rebar was comparable to steel rebar and commercial fiberglass composite rebar. The sand coating increased the surface roughness, improving the bond strength of the composite rebar by margins of 43-58% percent. Fiberglass/epoxy composite rebar consolidated with prepreg aramid tow and subsequently coated with sand resulted in a bond strength slightly higher, but comparable to steel. This study demonstrates the ability to consistently produce high quality fiberglass/epoxy composite rebar using an innovative, low cost, high production rate, three-dimensional braiding process. © 2018 33rd Technical Conference of the American Society for Composites 2018.

The overall information is obtained by combining SCADA-and phasor measurement unit-derived data, where time stamping (based on Global Positioning System or an equivalent local clock) for all measurements is assumed. Based on simulations performed in communication Network Simulator 2, empirical cumulative distribution functions can be associated with transfer times of measurement packets, which will reflect communication parameters and irregularities. This is further used to form an algorithm which maximizes the number of successful network observability checks, and thus the number of possible state estimations, in a certain time period.

One of these new methods involves researchers creating random peptides and testing their antimicrobial activity. Developing antibiotics from these peptides requires understanding which sequence motifs will be toxic to bacteria. To determine if the toxic peptides of a randomly-generated peptide library can be uniquely classified based solely on sequence motifs, we created the PepSeq Pipeline: a new software that utilizes a Random Forest algorithm to extract motifs from a peptide library. We found that this pipeline can accurately classify 56% of the toxic peptides in the peptide library using motifs extracted from the model. Testing on simulated data with less noise, we could classify up to 94% of the toxic peptides. The pipeline extracted significant toxic motifs in every library that was tested, but its ability to classify all toxic peptides depended on the number of motifs in the library. Once extracted, these motifs can be used both to understand the biology behind why certain peptides are toxic and to create novel antibiotics.

This paper presents a novel approach that involves treating the team as a moldable volume, in which deformations of the volume correspond to changes in team shape. The team possesses a level of autonomy that allows the team to travel to and surround buildings of interest in a patrol and cordon scenario. During surround mode, the operator explores or manipulates the team shape to create desired formations around a building. A spacing interaction method also allows the operator to adjust how robots are spaced within the current shape. Separate haptic feedback is developed for each method to allow the operator to ""feel"" the shape or spacing manipulation. During travel mode, the operator chooses desired travel locations and receives feedback to help identify how and where the team travels. Results from a user study suggest that haptic feedback significantly improves operator performance in a reconnaissance task when task demand is higher, but may slightly increase operator workload. In the context of the experimental setup, these results suggest that haptic feedback may contribute to heads-up control of a team of autonomous robots.

We present and evaluate a set of graphical user interfaces (GUIs), that are designed to allow a human to express intent by expressing desirable tradeoffs. The GUIs require an algorithm that identifies the set of Pareto optimal solutions to the multi-objective decision problem, which means that all the solutions are equally good in the sense that there are no other solutions better for every objective. Given the Pareto set, the GUIs provide different ways for a human to express intent by exploring tradeoffs between objectives; once a tradeoff is selected, the solution is chosen. The GUI designs are applied to interactive human-robot path-selection for a robot in an urban environment, but they can be applied to other tradeoff problems.

Over recent years, this has led to the implicit assumption that the quality of such embeddings is determined solely by their ability to facilitate transfer learning. In this position paper we argue that pre-trained linguistic embeddings have value above and beyond their utility as input features for downstream tasks. We adopt a paradigm in which they are instead treated as implicit knowledge repositories that can be used to solve common-sense reasoning problems via linear operations on embedded text. To validate this paradigm, we apply our methodology to tasks such as threat detection, emotional classification, and sentiment analysis, and demonstrate that linguistic embeddings show strong potential at solving such tasks directly, without the need for additional training. Motivated by these results, we advocate for empirical evaluations of language models that include vector-based reasoning tasks in addition to more traditional benchmarks, with the ultimate goal of facilitating language-based reasoning, or Ôreasoning in the linguistic domainÕ. We conclude by analyzing the structure of currently available embedding models and identifying several shortcomings which must be overcome in order to realize the full potential of this approach. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Common-sense reasoning; Language model evaluation; Language models; Sentence embeddings; Word embeddings,Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Intelligent computing; Sentiment analysis; Transfer learning; Based reasonings; Commonsense reasoning; Emotional classification; Empirical evaluations; Implicit knowledge; Internal representation; Linear operations; Threat detection; Embeddings,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088499748

It can be difficult to predict the transfer of distortion through a compressor because traditional experimental and computational methods are very expensive and time consuming. The Harmonic Balance approach is a promising alternative which uses Fourier techniques to represent fluid flow solutions. Relatively little work has been done to assess how much Fourier information is necessary to calculate a sufficiently accurate solution with the Harmonic Balance Solver. This study focuses on analyzing the effects of varying the amount of modal content that is used in Harmonic Balance simulations. Inlet distortion profiles with varying magnitudes are used in order to analyze trends and provide insight into the distortion flow physics for various inlet conditions. The geometry is a single stage axial compressor that consists of an inlet guide vane followed by the NASA Stage 37 rotor. It is shown that simulations with greater magnitudes of distortion require more modal content in order to achieve sufficiently accurate results.

For the community of researchers who are developing SAA technology for small UAS, there is a critical need for a rich, openly-accessible compendium of encounter data with which to develop, test, and evaluate SAA algorithms. In this paper we introduce a publicly available database of small UAS encounter data, the small aircraft flight encounter (SAFE) database, with an initial deposit of 11 flight encounters. In these encounters two target aircraft, a fixed-wing and a multi-rotor are imaged by a separate fixed-wing aircraft carrying two high-definition video cameras and a unique radar unit. The data contain ground-truth navigation estimates for both the target and imaging aircraft. The target aircraft are observed in the video footage but not in the radar imagery; continuing efforts include tuning and refinement of the radar parameters and expansion of the SAFE database to support small UAS SAA technology development. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

A three-way spectral decomposition quantifies the contribution from each noise type in the sound of a tied-down F-35B aircraft on a linear ground-based array spanning 35Ð152 deg. This large spatial aperture allows for detailed investigation into the spatial variation in broadband shock-associated noise and fine- and large-scale turbulent mixing noise. The spectral models used in the decomposition capture the main features of the measured spectra with three exceptions: 1) that the F-35B engine noise contains multiple spectral peaks in the maximum radiation region, 2) that the nonlinear propagation increases the high-frequency spectral levels, and 3) that the low-frequency levels in the maximum radiation region are less than those predicted by the large-scale similarity spectrum. The F-35B broadband shock-associated noise has the same characteristic shape and variation in peak frequency as overexpanded, laboratory-scale jets. However, the peak level and width exhibit different trends than laboratory-scale broadband shock-associated noise and those recently reported for the F/A-18E aircraft. The strengths and limitations of current models to represent the spatial variation in the spectral content of F-35B noise can guide research efforts to more fully understand the sound radiation.

We asked members of the computational optimization and wind communities to take part in the studies that we designed. Nine individuals participated. Case study 1 considered variations in optimization strategies for a given simple Gaussian wake model. Participants were provided with a wake model that outputs annual energy production (AEP) for an input set of wind turbine locations. Participants used an optimization method of their choosing to find an optimal wind farm layout. Case study 2 looked at trade-offs in performance resulting from variation in both physics model and optimization strategy. For case study 2, participants calculated AEP using a wake model of their choice while also using their chosen optimization method. Participants then used their wake model to calculate the AEP of all other participantsÕ optimized layouts. Results for case study 1 show that the best optimal wind farm layouts in this study were achieved by participants who used gradient-based optimization methods. A front-runner emerged with the Sparse Nonlinear OPTimizer plus Wake Expansion Continua-tion (SNOPT+WEC) optimization method, which consistently discovered the highest submitted AEP. For case study 2, two participants found a similar layout that was judged to be superior by all five participants. It is unclear if the better solution resulted from an improved optimization process, or a wake model that was more amenable to optimization. © 2019 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

It uses a combination of blade element momentum theory, blade composite structures, empirical motor and motor controller mass data, as well as a first order motor performance model. The battery optimization seeks to optimally size the battery for a circular orbit. Fixed point iteration between these optimization frameworks yields a flight path and propulsion system that slightly decreases solar capture, but signif-icantly decreases power expended. Fully coupling the trajectory and design optimizations with this level of accuracy is infeasible with current computing resources. These efforts show the benefits of combining design and trajectory optimization to enable the feasibility of SRHALE flight. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

There are a variety of factors that affect how well an area is surveyed. We specifically analyzed the effect both vehicle properties and communication had on the swarm search performance. We used non-dimensionalization to examine the effect vehicle properties had on search performance so the results can be applied to any domain size with any number and type of vehicle. We found that even if vehicles could only sense 10% of the grid area at any given time step, 92% of the grid could still be searched by using a vehicle with good maneuverability and endurance. Conversely, if the chosen vehicle had poor maneuverability 92% of the grid could still be searched by keeping the endurance high and increasing the amount of area the vehicles could sense at one time to 70% of the domain area. In addition, we also examined four communication cases with different amounts of information regarding vehicle location. We found communication increased search performance by at least 6.3%.

Several methods exist for stowing, deploying, and stiffening large space arrays. Often these functions are performed by separate systems. This paper presents a novel array system that integrates these functions into one system, without the need for external deployment or stiffening structures. The integration comes from the combination of the kinematics of origami-based folding approaches, stored strain energy of compliant hinges, and tension cables. Additionally, due to the origami-based folding approach used, tunable deployed shapes and retraction are possible using reeled cables. The result is a new class of arrays that are self-deployable, self-stiffening, and retractable (SDSR), which are described in this work. To understand the behavior of such systems, this paper presents the modeling and testing of an SDSR array using an origami flasher pattern and discusses the results for the performance metrics of stiffness and shape. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

In this paper, we perform wind farm layout optimization using a simple wake model and compare the resulting improvements to large-eddy simulation (LES) results to confirm that the layout was actually improved. We begin by describing the models used, including changes specific for use with gradient-based optimization. We then compare our modelsÕ output to previously published model and LES results. Using the models described, we performed gradient-based wind farm layout optimization using exact gradients. Power production for the original and optimized layouts were recalculated using LES.

Time-accurate, full annulus simulations were carried out to capture and analyze the processes leading to stall inception for uniform inlet conditions. Unsteady interaction between tip clearance flow and the detached normal shock inside of the blade passages became more prevalent at flow rates close to stall, and this unsteadiness likely provides a way for leading edge spillage to occur and initiate the stall process. Although reversed flow at the trailing edge plane was not observed to be more prevalent in simulations near stall than in simulations away from stall, the phenomenon was shown to occur in blade passages that were approaching a stall cell. Understanding the physical processes that lead to stall inception allows fan designers to design more robust fans that can safely take advantage of the better performance associated with operating closer to stall. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Phase shift is a measure of the rotational translation of a distortion profile and is valuable for understanding the translational motion of distortion as it passes through the fan. At choke and design operating conditions the phase shift is positive in the direction of rotor rotation. At near-stall the phase shift is negative opposite rotor rotation for the outer 30% span.

While fuel based propulsion technologies typically increase in specific power with increasing size, electric propulsion is typically much more scalable. This system scalability enables alternative designs including distributed propulsion, optionally powered propulsion units, and vectored thrust, which can all contribute to better runway performance and range. In this paper, we explore how continuously powered distributed propulsion can reduce takeoff distance while still satisfying range constraints. We use a combination of a blade element momentum method, a vortex lattice method, experimental data, and nonlinear optimization techniques to model and explore the design space. We have found that for this conceptual design study, a fully blown wing with propellers at the optimal diameter for the load (8 propellers for a 300 km range constraint) can reduce the takeoff distance by over 80% when compared to the optimal 2 propeller case using the same models. There is over a 2x increase in the wing lift coefficient which leads to a 36% reduction in liftoff speed. Also, the optimal fully blown case produced 2.9 more thrust during takeoff with only an 11% increase in total aircraft mass. Using propeller tip speed as a surrogate for noise, we found that the propeller tip speed decreased takeoff performance in an exponential manner: the tip speed could be decreased from Mach 0.8 to Mach 0.5 with only a 2x increase in takeoff rolling distance while decreasing the constraint to Mach 0.3 produced an 8x increase. © 2018, (publisher Name).

Synchronous measurements along a linear ground array approximately parallel to the shear layer were used to image the entire field through multisource statistically optimized near-field acoustical holography (M-SONAH). The field in the direction of maximum radiation consists of multiple lobes in the spatiospectral domain, which are manifest as multiple local maxima in space for a fixed frequency or multiple peaks in the spectra at a fixed location. Multiple lobes are observed at non-afterburning and afterburning engine conditions. As frequency increases for a given engine power, lobes appear towards the sideline and shift aft until they disappear beyond the measurement aperture and new lobe(s) take their place. As engine power is increased at a fixed frequency, the forwardmost lobe increases in its relative contribution to the field, which is a major contributing factor to the forward shift in overall directivity with increasing engine power. Field reconstructions and data in the forward direction outside of the region of maximum radiation show the presence of broadband shock-associated noise (BBSAN) for 75% ETR and above. Reconstructions along the nozzle lipline of the jet indicate the BBSAN originates from approximately the same region as the sources for the main radiation direction. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

The primary noise sources originate from interactions between turbulent mixing noise associated with large and finescale turbulent structures and the ambient air. A nonideally expanded jet also contains broadband shock-associated noise. A three-way decomposition of the spectral density measured near a tied-down F-35B quantifies the contribution from each type of noise. The decomposition is performed on noise from a ground-based, linear array of microphones, approximately 8 m from the estimated shear layer, which spanned an angular aperture of 35¡ to 152¡ (relative to engine inlet). This large spatial aperture allows for a detailed investigation into the spatial variation in broadband shock-associated noise and fine and large-scale turbulent mixing noise. The spectral decompositions match the measured spectral levels with three main exceptions: 1) the F-35B noise contains multiple spectral peaks in the maximum radiation region, 2) nonlinear propagation increases the high-frequency spectral levels, and 3) the low-frequency levels in the maximum radiation region are less than those predicted by the large-scale similarity spectrum. The main peak of the F-35B broadband shock-associated noise, evident from 35¡-70¡, has the same characteristic shape and variation in peak frequency as overexpanded, laboratory-scale jets. The F-35B broadband shockassociated noise peak level and width exhibit different trends than laboratory-scale BBSAN and those recently reported for the F/A-18E [Tam et al., Journal of Sound and Vibration, Vol. 422, 2018, pp. 92-111]. The strengths and limitations of current models to represent the spatial variation in the spectral content of F-35B noise can guide research efforts to more fully understand the sound radiation from high-performance military aircraft. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

This paper presents comparisons between static ground run-up and flyover measurements for the F-35 operating at 150% Engine Thrust Request. The overall sound pressure levels and spectra are shown for the two scenarios, as well as indicators of nonlinear propagation and shock content, specifically the derivative skewness and average steepening factor. The overall sound pressure level is reduced in the peak radiation direction aft of the aircraft but increased in the forward direction. The peak frequency of the noise is relatively unaffected by flight effects, though the amplitude of each frequency may vary. The increase in level in the forward direction results in shock formation that is absent during ground run-up measurements. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Six engine power conditions ranging from 25% to 150% engine thrust request were measured using a 71-microphone linear ground array located approximately 8 m from the estimated shear layer. Mixing noise trends with engine power for the round-nozzle F-35B are similar to those of a nominally rectangular-nozzle high-performance jet aircraft [Harker et al, AIAA, 2016]. Cross-correlation and coherence measures are used to corroborate and confirm identifications of fine- and large-scale turbulent mixing noise contributions from a concurrent study of the F-35B dataset [Neilsen et al., AIAA, 2018]. The relationships observed between multiple spatiospectral lobes seen in the maximum radiation regions of prior and concurrent high-performance aircraft noise studies [Leete et al., AIAA, 2018] are confirmed and expanded upon. Correlograms help identify how the multiple spatiospectral lobes have different apparent phase speeds across the array, corresponding to different directionality, some components of which also change with engine power. Increased overlap of lobes with increased engine power appears to drive global decreases in field coherence. Finally, the structure of the spatiospectral lobes appears to be more visible in nondimensionalized coherence length than in the spectrum itself. Broadband shock-associated noise (BBSAN) is found in the upstream direction at engine powers of 75% engine thrust request and above. Coherence is also used to separate BBSAN from jet mixing noise because the BBSAN is coherent within the relevant frequency range while adjacent fine-scale mixing noise is not. However, correlation and coherence analyses show that the upstream BBSAN signature is related to sound received in the peak radiation region dominated by the spatiospectral lobes. Possible links between the shock-associated noise and the spatiospectral lobes are discussed. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

The resulting intensity vectors have been used with a ray-tracing technique to identify the dominant source region over a broad range of frequencies.

A multiple-wavepacket (MWP) model provides an analytical framework for jet-noise-like radiation to simulate jet noise field levels as well as the corresponding spatial coherence properties within the field. Here, a beamforming method with regularization is applied to noise measured by a linear array near a high-performance military aircraft. Beamforming results are decomposed into a reduced-order MWP model and the predicted radiation is validated in terms of level and coherence properties using benchmark measurements. Sound levels and coherence lengths generated by the beamforming results show good agreement with benchmark measurements over a range of frequencies that contribute significantly to the overall radiation. The MWP model is shown to predict full-scale specific features such as multilobe directivity patterns, and the addition of an uncorrelated distribution (UD) model adequately predicts the sideline radiation that is otherwise difficult to reproduce from wavepacket radiation. The MWP model predicted radiation characteristics are an improvement over single-wavepacket models, which do not incorporate spatiotemporal features of the radiation. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This definition of a wavepacket has the same characteristics as the large-scale turbulent mixing noise; if the turbulent mixing noise can be isolated, the associate equivalent acoustic wavepacketÑdefined as a pressure fluctuation on a cylinder around the jet nozzleÑcan be found. An estimate of the frequencydependent, spatial variation in the large-scale turbulent mixing noise comes from a similarity spectra decomposition of the measured autospectral density, which in turn leads to data-educed wavenumber axial spectra associated with the frequency-dependent equivalent wavepackets. This wavepacket eduction technique has been applied to acoustical measurements of an unheated, Mach 1.8 jet in the near and far fields. At both locations, the resulting frequency-dependent, data-educed wavenumber spectra exhibit different types of self-similarity for low and high frequency regimes that become apparent when the axial wavenumber is scaled by the acoustic wavenumber, with a transition band between the two regimes. As expected, the data-educed wavenumber spectra can be used to predict field levels in the dominant radiation lobe. Addition of an uncorrelated source distribution, derived from the similarity spectra decomposition associated with the fine-scale turbulent mixing noise, creates a model that accounts for the sideline levels. This field-prediction ability of the wavepacket-plus-uncorrelated-distribution model is tested using the near and far field measurements. When predicting the field at the other location, the modelÕs average error is less than 2 dB for St = 0.04-0.25 but increases for larger St because the apparent directivity changes from near to far field, likely due to the frequency dependence of the extended source region. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Metrics indicative of shock presence, specifically the skewness of the time derivative of the waveform, the average steepening factor, and a new wavelet-based metric called the shock energy fraction (SEF), are used to quantify the strength and prevalence of acoustic shocks within waveforms recorded 10-305 m from a tethered military aircraft. The derivative skewness is more sensitive to the presence of the largest and steepest shocks, while the ASF and SEF tend to emphasize aggregate behavior of the entire waveform. These metrics are applied at engine conditions ranging from 50% to 150% engine thrust request, over a wide range of angles and distances, to assess the growth and decay of shock waves. The responses of these metrics point to significant shock formation occurring through nonlinear propagation out to 76 m from the microphone array reference position. Although these strongest shocks decay, the metrics point to continued nonlinear propagation in the far-field, out to 305 m. Many of these features are accurately characterized using a nonlinear propagation scheme based on the Burgers equation, but this scheme fails to account for multipath interference and significant atmospheric effects over the long propagation distances, resulting in an overestimation of nonlinearity metrics. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

However, measurements of full-scale, high-performance military aircraft reveal phenomena that are not widely seen at laboratory scales. Recent modifications to LES methods allow for simulations of jets operating at a high temperature ratio, in a similar regime as military aircraft operating at afterburner. This work applies coherence analyses that have been previously used to study the jet noise field produced by military aircraft to the LES of a highly-heated, laboratory-scale jet. The coherence of the complex pressures along a near-field line approximately parallel to the shear layer shows evidence of four distinct field regions. The coherence between this line and complex pressures along the simulated jet lipline provide source regions in the jet plume corresponding to each field region. Differences in how information is transferred from the flow to the field suggests that the source regions represent different noise production mechanisms. The field regions compare favorably to some spatiospectral lobe features observed in measurements of an F-35B aircraft operating at afterburner, though do not reproduce all of the phenomena present in the aircraftÕs jet noise field. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This study investigates the apparent source locations of events related to crackle for a high-performance military jet aircraft using an event-based, time-domain beamforming method. This method utilizes the cross correlation between adjacent microphones to determine the angle of propagation of an ensemble of shock-related events within the time waveform. This angle of propagation is then traced back towards the source to find the apparent source location. Based on the angle of propagation, derivative skewness, and overall sound pressure level, the microphone pairs along the array can be sorted into six groups. With increasing engine condition, groups related to the presence of crackle tend to shift downstream and broaden, in qualitative agreement with the general aeroacoustic source locations. However, a comparison with near-field acoustical holography shows that the apparent source region of crackle-related events appears upstream of the overall energy at intermediate power but appear to converge at maximum afterburner. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

A simplified geometry with a vertical coal hopper feeding into a 0.635-cm diameter horizontal pipe was used to represent key elements of the feed system. Coal particles were transported with 20-atm CO2 gas. The feed system was required to maintain a steady flow of gas and solids at a coal flow rate of approximately 3.8 g/s and a CO2 to coal mass ratio in the range 1-2. Sensitivity of model results to mesh size and particle interaction sub-model settings was assessed. Two design concepts were evaluated. A gravity-fed concept was found to be infeasible due to inadequate coal flow rates even at very high CO2 to coal flow ratios. This was due to gravitational forces being insufficient to move the pressurized coal from the hopper into the CO2 stream at the desired rate. A fluidized bed concept was found to provide the desired coal flow rate and CO2 to coal flow ratio. CO2 injected at the hopper base first fluidized the vertical coal bed before transporting it through a horizontal exit pipe. A second CO2 inlet downstream of the hopper exit pipe was used to dilute the fluidized coal and increase pipe velocities to minimize coal drop out. The amount of coal transported from the hopper was dependent on the net CO2 hopper flow but independent of the CO2 dilution flow. This meant that the coal flow rate and CO2 to coal flow ratio could be controlled independently. Pipe exit coal flow rates were found to fluctuate at levels acceptable for steady burner operation.

Among many factors shaping such commitments, the ethical climate within engineering degree programs specifically and universities more generally seems especially pertinent. Yet there remains a lack of research on, and understanding about, engineering students' perceptions of ethical climate, including how this changes over time and impacts their professional formation and values. This paper draws on an NSF-funded, mixed-methods, longitudinal research project conducted across four U.S. universities. The larger project aims to investigate perceptions and attitudes around ethics, social responsibility, and related concepts among engineering students. In this paper, we more specifically explore various facets of ethical climate across the three schools through a mixed-method explanatory study. We focus on quantitative survey measures (n=257) and qualitative interview data (n=33) collected from engineering students during their first and final years of college. We more specifically shed light on three main research objectives. First, we investigate how engineering students perceive ethical climate across the four universities. Second, we explore how students' perceptions of ethical climate change over time. Third, we look at how specific experiences may contribute to students' ethical climate perceptions, including changes over time. This study will appeal to engineering educators, policymakers and researchers who are interested in research on ethics, social responsibility, and related topics. By providing foundational insights about students' perceptions of ethical climate, we hope to inform strategies to improve the ethical climate at universities and ethical commitments of engineers. © 2020 SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

The design and implementation of these systems will be economically, transportationally, and environmentally important. In this paper, we use agent-based models to analyze the emergent behavior of several types of UAV systems with varying parameters and environments. We find that while increasing the number of UAVs initially has a more-than-linear effect on the reported separation incidents, this effect quickly levels off due to carrying capacity limitations. We also find that while different behaviors (objectives and movement patterns) of UAVs affects the locations of the separation incidents, the number of separation incidents is not strongly influenced by these changes. We then explore the implementation of separation-assurance mechanisms using varying levels of information, and examine effects on the emergent behavior. © 2017 IEEE.",high-density; modeling and simulation; Multi-agent modeling; UAV systems; unmanned aerial vehicles,Autonomous agents; Separation; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Vehicles; Air delivery systems; Capacity limitation; Design and implementations; Model and simulation; Multi-Agent Model; Separation assurances; UAV systems; Unmanned aerial vehicle systems; Multi agent systems,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021453322

Pollutants often accumulate to unhealthy concentrations during winter inversion events like those that commonly occur in the state of Utah and other mountainous regions. Electric vehicles (EV) are a potential solution to reduce harmful tail-pipe emissions that accumulate during inversions. This work represents a systems-level analysis of the degree to which replacing internal combustion engine vehicles (ICE) with EVs would reduce the near-road accumulation of criteria pollutants. The analysis draws on vehicle miles travelled data from major highways in Utah, vehicle fuel efficiency data, EPA-specified vehicle pollution emission standards, and local weather pattern trends. It employs two models, built in MATLAB and the agent-based modeling environment NetLogo, to determine pollutant concentrations, accumulation, and dispersion rates. These results are processed to determine changes in the Air Quality Index (AQI) caused by adjusting the percentage of EVs present within the vehicle population. The analysis concludes that replacing a significant percentage (80-100%) of the existing, fossil-fuel powered vehicle population with EVs would improve local AQI by 13 points. During extreme inversion events in Utah, these reductions would delay AQI levels from reaching 'red,' or unhealthy, status for enough time to allow local weather patterns to shift and dissipate the inversion event and accompanying pollution. Such a drastic reduction in AQI translates into better adolescent and elderly health and could minimize the risk of early onset asthma and other respiratory illnesses in regions negatively affected by high traffic pollution and winter inversion events. © 2018 IEEE.",Criteria pollutants; Electric vehicles; Environmental impact; Inversion; Modeling and simulation,,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048854895

This improvement can be shown by using a continuous time Markov chain. However, typical Markov chain models do not model common cause failures (CCF), which is a singular event that simultaneously causes failure in multiple redundant modules. This paper introduces a new Markov chain to model CCF in TMR with repair systems. This new model is compared to the idealized models of TMR with repair without CCF. The fundamental limitations that CCF imposes on the system are shown and discussed. In a motivating example, it is seen that CCF imposes a limitation of 51_ on the reliability improvement in a system with TMR and repair compared to a simplex system, (i.e., without TMR). A case study is also presented where the likelihood of CCF is reduced by a factor of 18_ using various mitigation techniques. Reducing the CCF compounds the reliability improvement of TMR with repair and leads to a overall system reliability improvement of 10,000_ compared to the simplex system as supported by the proposed model. © 2020 IEEE.",Common cause failure; Continuous time Markov chains; Systems with repair; Triple modular redundancy (TMR),Continuous time systems; Fault tolerant computer systems; Maintainability; Markov chains; Repair; Time-to-failure; Common cause failure; Continuous time Markov chain; Fundamental limitations; Markov chain models; Mitigation techniques; Reliability improvement; System reliability; Triple modular redundancy; Redundancy,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090471842

However, the ability to rapidly assess the performance of these design concepts, with sufficient fidelity, is a current weakness of this nascent industry. This paper explores the capacity of the viscous Vortex Particle Method (VPM) to model wake interactions found in distributed propulsion. The elements of the vortex particle method are summarized, and a new approach for the calculation of vortex stretching through the complex-step derivative approximation is presented. Preliminary validation is performed on vortex ring cases resembling the fundamental dynamics encountered in propeller wakes. Unsteady wake dynamics of individual propellers are successfully modeled, replicating the instabilities that lead to vortex breakdown as observed experimentally. Comparing the method with results from momentum theory, it is shown that VPM is consistent with theoretical values of near and far field induced velocities, and a notable feature is its ability to model near/far field transition. Furthermore, VPM is able to fully characterize induced velocities across the entire wake, from the stable region where momentum theory operates, through instability transition and eventual vortex breakdown. The simulation of a multirotor configuration of two tip-to-tip propellers is shown, displaying the capacity of VPM to model wake mixing. The results presented here are intermediate steps in the development of a mid-fidelity modeling tool for the early design stages of distributed-propulsion electric aircraft. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The DPT consists of a 74 mm diameter cone tip driven by a 120 kg hammer with a free fall height of 1 m. To expand the data base, DPT soundings were performed at the Pence Ranch and Larter Ranch sites where gravelly soil liquefied during the 1983 Mw6.9 Borah Peak earthquake. DPT testing was performed using an automatic hammer with the energy specified in the Chinese standard and with an SPT hammer. In general, comparisons suggest that standard energy corrections developed for the SPT can be used for the DPT. The DPT correctly predicted liquefaction and non-liquefaction at these two test sites. Liquefaction resistance from the DPT (30% probability) also correlated reasonably well with that from Becker penetration testing (BPT).

Although not exclusive to new faculty, the target audience and predominant attendees, were new faculty from the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines on campus. The three-day workshop focused on basic principles of effective learning and teaching, aligning learning outcomes to assessments and teaching activities, methods for active learning, and strategies for effective classroom presentation. The workshop curriculum was centered around the following goals: 1) promoting broader awareness of alternative teaching strategies for STEM classrooms, 2) increasing faculty comfort level in using alternative teaching strategies, 3) increasing adoption of active learning and other evidence-based pedagogies, 4) building a campus community dedicated to improving teaching, and 5) increasing multi-disciplinary collaborations amongst faculty attendees. The purpose of this paper is to provide an example of a model workshop designed to help new faculty engage students in STEM disciplines, and includes the planning, implementation, and assessment of this workshop. The paper begins by introducing the development of the workshop, including the logic model and assessment plan, the curriculum outline, and preparation processes. The paper also explores the implementation lessons learned. Finally, this paper includes the assessment results of the effectiveness of the workshop in meeting the workshop goals. This includes a preand post-workshop comparison of the participant's attitudes regarding evidence based pedagogies and their perceived competency in using them. This paper is useful for engineering educators in developing teaching expertise, researchers interested in faculty attitudes and perceived competency in using alternate teaching strategies, and faculty and administrators planning to create professional development opportunities to help faculty of all levels become more proficient in evidence-based pedagogies. This paper also serves as an example of a model workshop to develop interdisciplinary communities of educational practice, as well as strengthen the abilities of a new faculty in establishing an engaging and effective classroom. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",,"Artificial intelligence; Curricula; Education; Engineering education; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Students; Classroom presentations; Effective learning; Engineering educators; Multi-disciplinary collaborations; Preparation process; Professional development opportunities; Science , technology , engineering , and maths; Teaching activities; Teaching",Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030536289

A combination of visual art and innovative engineering offers an unusual opportunity to engage a wide spectrum of society. To evaluate the potential, faculty and students collaborated with the Brigham Young University Museum of Art to create a museum exhibition that connected the art of origami to engineering, math, science, and product design. A framework is introduced that includes the creation of a museum exhibition; and once the initial investment is made to create the central exhibition, the results are efficiently used to extend outreach efforts through first-generation products (coincident with the exhibition) and then through second-generation products (after the exhibition). The paper describes a detailed example of this framework and provides evidence to support the concept that displaying research artifacts in an art museum can expand research opportunities. Products from the exhibition that provided expanded outreach opportunities include the following: an exhibit catalog originally created for the gift shop that was expanded for publication with a national publisher; a tablet/smart phone app that includes origami instructions followed by related engineering activities, which has had broad use beyond the museum activity room; a video that was prepared for museum patrons but has since been made available to larger audiences; materials created for hands-on museum activities that were used for outreach activities after the exhibition; and leverage for industry visits that led to additional applications and research projects.

Concerns also persist about the moral and ethical commitments of engineers once they enter the workplace, as underscored by a number of recent ethics scandals involving engineers and technology. The education of ethically adept engineers therefore remains a pertinent issue for the engineering education community. Yet there remains relatively little research on how students' prior experiences shape their ethical perspectives. Specifically, there is a lack of understanding of the role of pre-college and early college experiences and other influences in shaping first-year engineering students' views on ethics. This paper reports select results from an NSF-funded project aiming to address some of these gaps in the literature. This longitudinal study was conducted across four universities and focused on the ethical development of undergraduate engineering students. Preliminary analysis of interviews from the first phase of this study identified a number of major themes in the data set, two of which are important to highlight here: 1) influences on students' ethical perspectives (e.g., academic curricular, extracurricular activities, family, etc.) and 2) learned outcomes, defined as insights, learning, or realizations related to ethics, morality, and values. Deeper investigation of the relationship between specific influences and students' insights related to ethics can provide a better understanding of first-year engineering students' baseline ethical development. The goal of this paper is to characterize what specific ethical lessons are gained through various types of experiences, as well as to glean how this learning and growth occurs. Data for this study was drawn from 66 interview transcripts and consisted of sections coded simultaneously for influences and learned outcomes. The cross-coded data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. The types of influences impacting students' ethical learning, and exemplars of how students report their lived experiences and ethical realizations, are discussed through the lens of what they learned and the mechanisms through which they gained these understandings. Our analysis suggests that several pre-college (e.g., extracurricular activities, service/volunteer roles and social experiences) and early college experiences (e.g., academic courses, part-time employment) play a critical role in shaping students' ethical perspectives. We more specifically present our findings organized around eight types of experiences and influences, which are in turn related to three categories of learned outcomes and three types of learning mechanisms. As we discuss in more detail below, the results of this study will likely be of interest to engineering educators, policymakers, and researchers with an interest in administering and studying high-impact ethics interventions for undergraduate engineering students. More specifically, our results underscore the importance of being more aware of how students' background perspectives and experiences likely play important roles in enabling or disabling their further ethical development. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.",,,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051230130

The course is part of an overall leadership framework whereby students are introduced to the importance of leadership as freshmen, learn foundational leadership principles as sophomores, and practice these principles as juniors and seniors. The leadership foundations course is required for graduation by 7 of 10 programs within the College of Engineering and Technology. Students external to the college also participate in the course as it fulfills two general education requirements for graduation. As a result, the college teaches approximately 12 sections each academic year averaging 60-80 students per section. Approximately 10-15% of student course participants are external to the college. In this paper a survey is presented of 163 students initially enrolled in the leadership foundations course regarding their perceptions and attitudes towards leadership. Results include a comparison of students who are required to take the course and those for whom it is optional. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups of students except for their expectation regarding workload. The engineering and technology students expected the leadership foundations course to be easier, relative to their other classes, than the nonengineering and technology group. In general, both sets of students had high expectations for the course and expressed positive attitudes towards learning about leadership. For example, students in both groups indicated they felt learning about leadership was somewhat more important than learning the skills of their discipline. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",,Education; Engineering education; Foundations; Teaching; College of Engineering and Technology; Engineering and technology; General education; Leadership principles; Positive attitude; Sophomore-level; Statistically significant difference; Student perceptions; Students,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030572436

This shift in computing expectations focuses on the ability to compute horizontally, performing the same tasks within different computing environments, as opposed to vertically, performing different tasks in the same computing environment. In this paper, we propose a method by which the usability of a given piece of software can be comparatively analyzed across all hardware platforms on which it is available. This methodology is based on the Majrashi and Hamilton's twelve factors of usability and has been extended to include specific applications and metrics for the following computing platforms: desktop computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones. These metrics focus on collecting quantitative data about the usability of each platform. This quantitative data contrasts with recent studies which focus extensively on qualitative data regarding the user experience. Combining these two types of studies will allow researchers to capture a more comprehensive picture of software usability across computing platforms. The methodology has been validated by performing an initial study using the tasks and performance metrics across each of the defined computing platforms. The results from these initial tests have allowed us to make improvements to the testing methodology as well as some hypotheses for further testing. This proposed methodology, when used in conjunction with qualitative research, can provide a reliable approach for cross-platform usability analysis. Some considerations for educational design of cross platform methodology are discussed. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.",,Computer hardware; Computer software; Engineering education; Hardware; Laptop computers; Personal computers; Smartphones; Computing environments; Computing hardware; Computing platform; Performance metrics; Qualitative research; Software usabilities; Testing methodology; Usability analysis; Usability engineering,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030555769

Many college courses have a familiar format: students listen to lectures, read textbooks, complete assignments, and demonstrate their learning through exams. Often, the instructor will structure the course for convenience, perhaps creating highly structured PowerPoint presentations and using standardized multiple choice exams to easily grade performance. Students, on the other hand, then structure their learning practices to match - trying to determine exactly how much to come to class, read, and memorize, with the end goal of regurgitating information on the exam and getting a satisfactory grade in the course. These practices are not conducive to long-term retention and application by the students, nor to accurate assessment or facilitation of learning by the instructor. But unless both the instructor and the students in a course understand and are amenable to alternative techniques, the format is unlikely to change. There has been extensive research on techniques aimed to increase student engagement in the classroom, such as ""flipping the classroom"" and identifying and overcoming the ""illusion of learning."" This paper describes the efforts of the author over three semesters to incorporate these tools into a senior-level course on manufacturing system design and lean manufacturing to help facilitate better learning and assess proficiency more effectively. Several techniques are used, including suggestions from the recent book Make It Stick by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel. Student feedback and instructor observations are discussed, and future recommendations for the course are given. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.",Flipped classroom; Illusion of learning; Student-centered learning,,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051197279

This analysis is used to determine the conditions under which an over-design approach provides a greater benefit than a redesign approach. Over-design is found to have a higher net present value than redesign when future requirements occur soon after the initial release, discount rates are low, initial research and development cost or price is high, and when the incremental costs of the future requirements are low.

However, less research has been done on measuring the impact of these programs on the affected communities. This paper examines factors that practitioners believe are related to successfully delivering a desirable and transferable solution to affected communities. The authors identified 46 distinct factors from the literature that implicitly or explicitly are suggested to contribute to successful project outcomes. Formed as postulates in this paper, these 46 factors have been separated into 5 categories to assist understanding and implementing these factors into service learning programs. Lastly, different methods of analyzing and measuring project success and impact are discussed. Future methods for proving the viability of the 46 postulates are discussed as well.

Changes in the force applied during a nanoinjection and varying the number of repeated nanoinjections on the same cotyledon were observed. Too much force or too many repeated injections caused physical damage to the cotyledon. An optimal force and number of repeated injections can be performed without causing physical damage to the cotyledon. Several injections using DNA were performed without successful transfection of the leaves. Possible reasons for this failure to transfect were explored.

This paper describes a process that can be employed to use sheet metal in designs of origami-adapted mechanisms that utilize specific thickness-accommodation techniques. The process is demonstrated for a square-twist mechanism designed using the hinge shift technique for accommodating thickness in origami patterns. A Miura-ori mechanism is also shown in sheet metal. The characteristics of these bent panel approaches are discussed and compared to other approaches for designing panels for manufacturing.

This work presents data structures based on origami that can be used in the automation of thick-origami mechanism design. These structures are described and an example computer program that implements them is investigated. The program automatically generates all the necessary 3D CAD part models and an assembly model for a user-specified origami crease pattern.

These interviews were then transcribed, coded, and analyzed for themes that may have been well understood or misunderstood by students. We found that a significant number of students had not understood concepts such as a design being more than a prototype, that sponsors have expectations for the tradeoffs between product cost and performance, or that they need to be thinking about how their designs might be deployed. It was also interesting to note that most students also reported feeling confident in their understanding despite their apparent lack thereof, indicating that these could represent major blind spots for students. We propose that developing methods for teaching these principles early on will help students see more clearly what their end goals need to be, and thus help them be more successful in delivering desirable designs.

The course is offered as a study abroad program where faculty lead a group of students across several countries to learn about global product development. This is accomplished in a 2-3 week time period consisting of visits to companies and universities as well as participation in cultural activities. While much research has been done on the benefits of study abroad, it remains unclear how effective study abroad programs are at helping engineering students, especially short-term study abroad programs. The purpose of this paper is to present and examine the benefits of a short-term, study abroad program to engineering students. Data was collected from students who have taken the Global Product Development Course over the past 15 years in a mixed methods survey. Trends show that technical and cultural visits positively effect engineering students in their perception of global product development. It is also shown that a short, 2-3 week, engineering study abroad program can be as or more effective than traditional study abroad programs in certain areas.

Mechanical hand pumps have a long history of helping people access clean ground water for drinking and daily use. Among the most ubiquitous are the India Mark II and III pump systems, for which there are more than 4,000,000 installed across the world. These are estimated to serve between 600M and 1B people. All pumps degrade in performance over time, requiring service; many do not receive it causing pumps to become dysfunctional. The purpose of this paper is to establish a baseline for nitrile seal performance of India Mark II hand pump systems. Understanding off-the-shelf performance and using it as a baseline is an important step toward understanding degradation of performance over time, which is the focus of a much larger study to understand Ð mechanically and socially Ð how hand pumps perform, degrade, and ultimately meet human needs. In this paper, 110 off-the-shelf nitrile seals that were purchased in Uganda were tested and the following was characterized: (i) geometric variation, (ii) material variation, (iii) leak performance, and (iv) correlation between these. The seal leak performance was found to be very robust to variations in geometry and material at zero cycles. This important baseline supports our future work to understand how and to what degree seals become sensitive to geometric and material degradation during use.

Although social impact assessments (SIA) and social life cycle assessments (SLCA) are two of the most common evaluative processes discussed in the literature, not a single company interviewed used either of these processes despite affirming that they do consider social impact in product design. Predictive processes were discussed by the respondents that tended to be developed within the company and often related to government regulations.

CVI results from incompetent venous valves. The purpose of venous valves is to prevent retrograde blood flow to the lower limbs. Valve failure can lead to edema, pain, and ulcers. One solution that has great potential is to create an implantable venous valve that could restore function of the venous system. No prosthetic venous valves are clinically used currently because of problems with biocompatiblility and thrombogenicity caused by high shear rates. This paper presents a prosthetic venous valve that could overcome these difficulties by using carbon-infiltrated carbon nanotubes (CI-CNTs). This material has been proven to be thrombo-resistant, biocompatible due to its non-reactive properties, and durable. The valve was designed to be initially open and to close with physiological pressures. Finite element modeling showed that, with a hydrostatic pressure of 20 mmHg (the minimum hydrostatic pressure in the common femoral vein), it fully closed with a maximum stress of 117 MPa, which is below the ultimate strength of CI-CNTs. A computational fluid dynamics analysis demonstrated the valve would cause a maximum shear rate of 225.1 s_ 1, which is less than the maximum shear rate in the body. Hence, this valve would be less likely than previous prosthetic valves to develop blood clots. Currently, this is the lowest shear rate reported for a prosthetic venous valve. These results demonstrate that a CI-CNT prosthetic venous valve has the potential to be an effective treatment for CVI.

Nevertheless, these methods often rely on only a vague or amorphous representation of the design space (the set of all possible concepts the design team could feasibly select to meet the objective of the project). In this paper, we introduce a particular design-space structure that can help teams ideate and evaluate their ideation, thus improving the early phases of the design process. The design space presented here is a vector space with a basis of technology (the physical product people will use) and tactics (the procedure for using the product). Also presented are definitions, principles, and sub-theories that facilitate the creation and use of technology-tactics plots to represent the design space. Considering the design space in this structured way, the design team can gain valuable insights that improve the effectiveness of the initial stages of design, and may yield additional benefits to the design process as a whole, if further developed.

One of the purposes of these products is to improve the consumer's quality of life. Currently, there is no established method of measuring the social impact of these types of products. As a result, engineers have used their own metrics to assess their product's impact, if at all. Some of the common metrics used include products sold and revenue, which measure the financial success of a product without recognizing the social successes or failures it might have. In this paper we introduce a potential metric, the Product Impact Metric (PIM), which quantifies the impact a product has on impoverished individuals - especially those living in developing countries. It measures social impact broadly in five dimensions: Health, education, standard of living, employment quality, and security. The PIM is inspired by the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) created by the United Nations Development Programme. The MPI measures how the depth of poverty within a nation changes year after year, and the PIM measures how an individual's quality of life changes after being affected by an engineered product. The Product Impact Metric can be used to predict social impacts (using personas that represent real individuals) or measure social impacts (using specific data from products introduced into the market). © 2017 ASME.",,Big data; Computer aided design; Design; Developing countries; Engineered products; Financial success; Impact metric; Quality of life; Social impact; Standard of living; United nations development programme; Economic and social effects,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034637111

Most existing methods for evaluating social impact indicators require direct human interaction with users of a product, such as one-on-one interviews. These interactions produce high-fidelity data that are rich in information but provide only a single snapshot in time of the productÕs impacts and are less frequently collected due to the significant human resources and cost associated with obtaining them. A framework is proposed that describes how low-fidelity data passively obtained using remote sensors, satellites, and digital technology can be collected and correlated with high-fidelity, low-frequency data using machine learning. Using this framework provides an inexpensive way to continuously monitor the social impact indicators of products by augmenting high-fidelity, low-frequency data with low-fidelity, continuously-collected data using machine learning. We illustrate an application of this framework by demonstrating how it can be used to examine the gender-related social impact indicators of water pumps in Uganda. The provided example uses a deep learning model to correlate pump handle movement (measured via an integrated motion unit) with user type (man, woman, or child) of 1,200 hand pump users.

This technique modifies a zerothickness pattern by splitting each vertex along the minor folds into a system of two vertices. The modified fold pattern then has thickness applied to it and the resulting mechanism is kinematically equivalent to the modified fold pattern. Origami patterns that are rigid-foldable and only have two panels that stack between folds are utilized in the technique. The technique produces thick origami mechanisms where all panels lie in a plane in the unfolded state without any holes or protrusions and maintain a single degree of freedom. Steps for synthesizing split-vertex mechanisms are presented and examples of split-vertex mechanisms are shown. Advantages and potential applications of the technique are discussed.

Analytical models for the kinematics and force-deflection of a unit cell based on two different modes of elastic energy absorption are derived. The force-deflection model is developed based on the application of compliant mechanism theory and virtual work analysis. The models are verified through comparison with published results for similar models, analysis using commercial kinematics software and comparison to physical testing. Physical prototypes are used to determine values stiffness terms. The analytical models are used to explore the effects of the key geometrical parameters of the tessellation.

Many origami structures can be thought of as a compliant mechanism because, like compliant mechanisms, its function is performed through the elastic deformation of its members. This stored strain energy could prove useful. There are opportunities using strain energy to develop approaches to deploy particular mechanical systems. In order to better understand the principles of self-actuation and promote the designs of such systems, a taxonomy of deployable origami mechanisms is presented. This taxonomy demonstrates that there are several different types of deployable origami mechanisms and provides an organizational method to better understand the design space.

Technology that combines accurate temperature measurement and 3D spatial control of the temperature distribution is limited by common 2D layer-based microfluidic fabrication techniques but can be realized with 3D printed microfluidic chips. This work presents an iterative process to create a microfluidic chip using multimaterial 3D printing to improve temperature sensing and create an even temperature around a target volume. Through an iterative process, verification is presented of fluorophore viability (specifically CdTe quantum dots) after being secured in place by cured PR48 3D printing resin, thus confirming the possibility of fluorescent thermometry as an accurate non-contact temperature sensing method. Numerical analyses of various geometries of chip design iterations are also presented verifying spatially even heating due to the placement of heating sources in the microfluidic chip. Combining the fluorescent thermometry and improved heating will lead to improved temperature control in microfluidic devices.

The thermal conductivity of these materials determines their ability to transfer heat from the reactor core to the surrounding coolant. Additionally, these actinide compounds are of interest in condensed matter physics because of the 5f orbitals and unique electron interaction, coupling, and scattering events that can occur. Because of the radioactivity of thorium and uranium, thin film measurements of actinide materials are used to limit the amount of operator exposure, but standard thermal characterization methods are not well suited for thin films. This paper presents the process of depositing thin film UOx and ThOx samples of nm-_m thicknesses and the results of thermal property measurements. Thin films were deposited on silicon and glass substrates via dc-magnetron sputtering using an argon/oxygen mixture as the working gas. The thermal properties of the films were measured by the Thermal Conductivity Microscope (TCM). This uses one laser to generate thermal waves and a second laser to measure the magnitude and phases of the thermal waves to obtain the conductivity of materials. The results of the research show that the UOx film properties are lower than bulk values and that the role of the substrate has a considerable effect on determining the measured properties.

In the past decade, due to its biocompatible nature, the medical field has expressed significant interest in magnesium for biodegradable implant applications. However, utilization of magnesium-based alloys in surgical implant applications is strictly limited by magnesiumÕs high vulnerability to corrosion causing premature disintegration inside the human body. Hydrophobic (non-wetting) behavior of metal surfaces has been proven to be beneficial for corrosion protection in academic literature. One way of achieving hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces on metal surfaces without using non-biocompatible coatings is creating uniform microstructures that would alter the wetting characteristics of the surface. This work focuses on creating uniform pillar shaped micro-patterns on smooth pure magnesium surfaces by utilizing a picosecond laser (_ = 355 nm). The study reports the effects of average laser power, partial laser beam overlap and number of laser scans on the height, steepness, roughness of the resultant micro-pillars. Information gathered from this study could be useful in creating more complex or finer micro-structures on magnesium and its alloys to alter their wetting or corrosion characteristics using laser ablation which is a fast, repeatable and an un-convoluted process.

This research applied and measured the impact of using surrogates to quickly model the stresses on a compressor blade. By modeling distinct points on a finite element (FE) model with unique surrogates, the stress field of the entire FE model was quickly predicted. This required that the distinct points remain in the same relative location on each blade used in training the surrogate. This research studied the ability of mesh morphing, and using the surface nodes as those distinct points, to satisfy this requirement. The results show that mesh morphing performed well on the tested compressor blades. The research also found that the surrogate accuracy depended not only on the number of training samples, but also the number and types of parameters being emulated. The surrogate models achieved less than 5% error on all the tested blades. Finally, the method provided a 96% decrease in time required for a structural iteration of a compressor blade. Such speeds eliminate bottlenecks that may occur in the structural design process. The combination of mesh morphing and surrogate modeling in compressor blade analysis enables exploration of various geometric parameters and their effect on structural responses. Application of this process would produce a more thoroughly refined and understood compressor blade design.

Deposits of heavy fuel oil ash were created in the Turbine Accelerated Deposition Facility (TADF) at Brigham Young University under gas turbine-related conditions. Ash was produced by burning heavy fuel oil in a downward-fired combustor and collecting the ash from the exhaust stream. The mass mean ash particle diameter from these tests was 33 microns. This ash was then introduced into the TADF and entrained in a hot gas flow that varied from 1088 to 1206¡C. The gas and particle velocity was accelerated to over 200 m/s in these tests. This particle-laden hot gas stream then impinged on a nickel base superalloy metal coupon approximately 3 cm in diameter, and an ash deposit formed on the coupon. Sulfur dioxide was introduced to the system to achieve 1.1 mol% SO2 in the exhaust stream in order to simulate SO2 levels in turbines currently burning heavy fuel oil. The ash deposits were collected, and the capture efficiency, surface roughness, and deposit composition were measured. The deposits were then washed with deionized water, dried, and underwent the same analysis. It was found that, as the gas temperature increased, there was no effect on capture efficiency and the post-wash roughness of the samples decreased. Washing aided in the removal of sulfur, magnesium, potassium, and calcium.

Four key parameters were identified as desirable to quantitatively capture distortion transfer, generation and effects on performance: distortion magnitude, shape, severity and phase. A set of distortion descriptors based on Fourier analysis are shown to quantitatively capture distortion magnitude, shape and phase change across bladerows.

Detailed information about the magnitude of distortion and the shape of the distortion profile and how it changes through blade rows increases the understanding of flow physics and helps predict aerodynamic performance. Using full annulus URANS simulations, this paper analyzes what happens to distortion as it passes through the rotor and stator blade rows at 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 90% span. Fourier distortion descriptors are used in this study to quantitatively describe distortion transfer and generation. With these descriptors, evidence of pressure-induced swirl is shown at the fan inlet. It is also shown that although there is very little distortion at the 10% span of the inlet, after passing through the rotor blade row the 10% span has the greatest amount of total pressure and total temperature distortion. This radial migration of distortion is attributed to the high hade angle of the hub. The total pressure and total temperature profiles have significant circumferential phase shifts after passing through the rotor and slight phase shifts after passing through the stator. In general, the calculated phase shifts are greatest at the 10% and 90% spans, the nearest locations to the hub and the tip clearance gap, respectively.

These results are used to explain the relationship between inlet total pressure distortion, pressure-induced swirl, total pressure distortion transfer, total temperature distortion generation, and circumferential rotor power variation. It is shown that very large changes in pressure-induced swirl and distortion transfer and generation occur between near-stall and design, but only small changes are seen between design and choke.

Several possible frameworks are examined, including a free-flight system in which UAVs are allowed to distribute themselves within the entire airspace; a stratified system where different layers are used for travel in different directions, and a compromise system where layers are specified, but vertical course deviation for conflict avoidance is permitted.

FRP rebar is generally as strong as steel rebar, but less susceptible to corrosion, providing a significant advantage over traditional steel reinforcement in concrete structures. In this study, a variety of different design configurations of carbon/epoxy composite cylindrical rebar rods were manufactured, embedded in concrete, and tested in axial tension to identify the relationships between manufacturing parameters and tensile pull-out strength of the rebar. The rebar was produced by combining multiple tows of carbon/epoxy prepreg to form the core of cylindrical rods which were consolidated using various spirally-wound consolidation fibers. The rods were cured at 121 degrees Celsius as specified by the material manufacturer, TCR Composites. The manufactured rods were approximately 10.4 mm in diameter. Primary variables investigated included the consolidation fiber material (aramid, fiberglass and basalt), prepreg vs. dry consolidation tows, the number of tows used to consolidate the rebar (i.e., the size of tows used to consolidate the rebar). Larger consolidation tows were created by braiding three smaller tows together. The consolidation tows also served the purpose of providing the rebar with ribs similar to those on steel rebar to improve bonding. Select rebar samples were subsequently coated with sand to increase rebar surface roughness for improved bonding with concrete. The rebar was cast in 200 mm _ 200 mm _ 200 mm concrete cubes to investigate bond strength. The strength of the bond between concrete and FRP rebar was investigated using the pull-out test detailed by ACI 440.3R-12. A test fixture was manufactured to enable testing using a standard tensile testing machine. Standard 12.7 mm diameter steel rebar and a commercially comparable fiberglass rebar were also tested to provide baseline values. Results showed that the bond strength was below 344 MPa (50 ksi) when dry winding was used regardless of whether a single or a multiple tow consolidation bundle was used. Prepreg consolidation combined with sand resulted in a bond strength of 478 MPa (69.3 ksi), comparable to steel at 464 MPa (67.2 ksi). The results demonstrated that consolidating the rods with a wet tow resulted in a rebar which bonded better with concrete than using a dry tow. During testing, it was discovered that dry consolidating materials would easily strip off the rod due to poor bonding. Sand was shown to significantly increase the bond strength of the composite rebar, by more than 30 percent. This study provides the basis for a proposed new low-cost manufacturing method for composite rebar as structural reinforcement in concrete. These preliminary results allowed for a test matrix to be set up where FRP rebar bond strength could be investigated in detail using higher quality samples and more controlled parameters. © 2017 The Composites and Advanced Materials Expo (CAMX).

At lower mesh levels of 1 million cells, there were slightly greater discrepancies between the structured trimmed-cell mesh and the unstructured polyhedral mesh, particularly with respect to the flame shape and upper furnace flux profile predicted in Case 3. Interestingly, the differences in thermal efficiency and total heat transfer were greater between Case 2 and Case 1 (2 million versus 1 million cells) than between Case 2 and Case 5 (2 million versus 1 million cells with poor refinement). This trend was also observed with Case 4 and Case 3. This suggests both cell count and local mesh refinement are important to achieving accurate combustion predictions, but that there is minimal difference between the results with differing mesh types as long as the cell count and refinement are sufficient to represent the expected jet mixing behavior. These results also suggest that while the flame shape does impact the boundary flux profile as expected, the impact on thermal efficiency may be less well correlated. Thus, total heat transfer results should not be used to assess flame shape behavior; boundary flux profiles provided better correlation to flame shape.",,Cells; Combustion; Cytology; Efficiency; Enthalpy; Fighter aircraft; Forecasting; Fuel burners; Fuels; Heat flux; Heat transfer; Mixing; Computational mesh; Critical factors; High velocity gradients; Local mesh refinement; Mesh refinement; Polyhedral meshes; Realistic simulation; Thermal efficiency; Mesh generation,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026803213

Data race freedom is a desirable property for task parallel programs but is difficult to prove because every possible execution of the program must be considered. A partial order over events of an observed program execution induces an equivalence class of executions that the program may also produce. The Does-not-Commute (DC) relation is an efficiently computable partial order used for data race detection. As a relatively weak partial order, the DC relation can represent relatively large equivalence classes of program executions. However, some of these executions may be infeasible, thus leading to false data race reports. The contribution of this paper is a mechanized proof that the DC relation is actually sound for commonly used task parallel programming models. Sound means that the first data race identified by the DC relation is guaranteed to be a real data race. A prototype analysis in the Java Pathfinder model checker shows that the DC relation can significantly reduce the number of explored states required to prove data race freedom in Habanero Java programs. In this application, the search for data race using the DC relation is both sound and complete. © 2019 FMCAD Inc.",,Computer aided design; Computer software; Equivalence classes; Formal methods; Model checking; Parallel programming; Data race detection; Java PathFinder; Mechanized proofs; Model checker; Parallel program; Program execution; Sound and complete; Task parallel; Java programming language,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075606362

Indeed, the way that control is shared between the human operator and the inherent collective robot behaviors determines in large part the success of the human-swarm system. In this paper, we seek to understand how to design human-swarm systems that effectively moderate human influence over a robot swarm. To do this, we implement a simulated swarm system based on honeybees, and study how interacting with this swarm using various methods of moderating human influence impacts the success of the resulting human-swarm system.

This paper proposes an automated process to identify mode shapes from gray-scale images of compressor blades within a jetengine. This work introduces mode shape identification using principal component analysis (PCA), similar to approaches in facial and other recognition tasks in computer vision. This technique calculates the projected values of potentially linearly correlated values onto P-linearly orthogonal axes, where P is the number of principal axes that define a subset space. Classification was done using support vector machines (SVM). Using the PCA and SVM algorithm, approximately 5300 training images representative of 16 different modes were used to create a classifier. The classifier achieved on average 98% accuracy when tested using a test set of approximately 2000 images given P D 70. The results suggest that using digital images to perform mode shape identification can be achieved with high accuracy. Potential generalization of this method could be applied to other engineering design and analysis applications. © The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2019.",Computer vision; Image processing; Machine learning; Mode shape identification; PCA,Automation; Classification (of information); Computer vision; Image processing; Learning systems; Machinery; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Structural health monitoring; Support vector machines; Automated process; Compressor blades; Engineering design; Finite element solver; Gray-scale images; Mode shapes; Orthogonal axes; Principal axes; Principal component analysis,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068321458

Human supervision and remote robot control are often required to operate robots in unpredictable and changing scenarios. Often, robots are controlled remotely by technicians via joystick interfaces which require training and experience to operate. To improve robot usage and practicality, we propose using augmented reality (AR) to create a more intuitive, less training-intensive means of controlling robots than traditional joystick control. AR is a creative platform for developing robot control systems, because AR combines the real world (the environment around the user, the physical robot, etc.) with the digital world (holograms, digital displays, etc.); it can even interpret physical gestures, such as pinching two fingers. In this research, a Microsoft Hololens headset is used to create an AR environment to control a Yaskawa Motoman SIA5D robot. The control process begins with the user placing an interactable holographic robot in 3D space. The user can then select between two control methods: manual control and automatic control. In manual control, the user can move the end effector of the holographic robot and the physical robot will respond immediately. In automatic control, the user can move the end effector of the holographic robot to a desired location, view a holographic preview of the motion, and select execute if the motion plan is satisfactory. In this preview mode, the user is able to preview both the motion of the robot and the torques experienced by the joints of the manipulator.

Acoustic source identification techniquesÕ have been used for remote structural health monitoring, but the applicability of each technique has been limited by factors ranging from achievable spatial resolution to hardware costs. This paper aims to mitigate current acoustic techniquesÕ limitations by exploring the possibility of fusing acoustic and video data. This paper focuses on combining microphone acoustic measurements with vibrational information recovered from video-based measurements. Among acoustic methods, acoustic arrays have been used for remotely detecting, localizing and characterizing acoustic sources. Acoustic-array based techniques are limited in their ability to discriminate multiple closely-spaced acoustic sources from far-field acoustic pressure signals. On the contrary, video-based techniques have shown the ability to recover full-field, high resolution mode shapes, and the associated frequencies and damping ratios with virtually no dependence with the distance from the target. The challenge with video methods, applied to acoustic source identification, is that acoustic sources may occur in the kilohertz range requiring a higher frame per second sampling rate than most low cost cameras. Acoustic measurements provide additional information content that is used to recover the correct frequency content of an acoustically radiating structure from temporally-aliased (sub-Nyquist) video measurements. Experiments are conducted to show how combining acoustic and video data relaxes the hardware requirements for acoustic source detection and localization applications. © 2020, The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc.",Signal aliasing; Structural health monitoring; Sub-Nyquist sampling; Vibro-acoustics; Video processing,Acoustic arrays; Acoustic measuring instruments; Acoustic noise measurement; Costs; Data fusion; Machinery; Recovery; Structural dynamics; Video recording; Acoustic measurements; Acoustic techniques; Frequency contents; Information contents; Safety and securities; Spatial resolution; Structural health; Vibrational information; Structural health monitoring,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092216153

Determining the end of primary consolidation is greatly exacerbated for layered soils that compress at varying rates. This paper discusses the use of magnet extensometer instrumentation to isolate compression within specific subsurface layers and associated techniques for estimating the time of construction induced settlement. Field data is used during construction to estimate the end of construction induced subsurface compression, which greatly affects the project schedule. This case study briefly summarizes instrumentation installation, data gathering, and the challenges associated with projecting the time of construction settlement. Two different curve fitting techniques were evaluated in this research: using standard primary consolidation equations and finite difference equations for estimating the end of primary consolidation settlement. For the site investigated, the curve fitting techniques proved to be somewhat problematic because the soil layers had small magnitudes of settlement and the transition between primary and secondary settlement was not readily apparent during the evaluation of real time field data. Using the finite difference equations also proved somewhat problematic trying to fit the full record of field data based on all of the different stages of loading. Additional lessons learned include the need for effective project communication between contractors, designers, and owners and a corresponding open discussion regarding practical settlement risk. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

To tolerate the severe variations in the subthreshold regime, a novel dynamic bulk biasing circuit senses the NMOS/PMOS strength ratio in the background and applies feedback to recover the circuit functionality. A new comparator relaxes the stringent speed-noise trade-off under the 0.2-V supply. Employing ac-coupling, stacked input pairs, and voltage-boosted load capacitors, the comparator achieves more than threefold improvement in speed with little noise penalty. The measured ADC consumes 22 nW and exhibits an SNDR of 52.8 dB at Nyquist, yielding an FoM of 12.3 fJ/conv.-step.

Often, ground-truth video of the activity is recorded along with sensor-data recorded during the activity. The data must be synchronized with the recorded video to be useful. In this paper, we present and compare two labeling frameworks that each has a different approach to synchronization. Approach A uses time-stamped visual indicators positioned on the data loggers. The approach results in accurate synchronization between video and data but adds more overhead and is not practical when using multiple sensors, subjects, and cameras simultaneously. Also, synchronization needs to be redone for each recording session. Approach B uses Real-Time Clocks (RTCs) on the devices for synchronization, which is less accurate but has several advantages: multiple subjects can be recorded on various cameras, it becomes easier to collect more data, and synchronization only needs to be done once across multiple recording sessions. Therefore, it is easier to collect more data which increases the probability of capturing an unusual activity. The best way forward is likely a combination of both approaches. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Annotating; Camera; IMU; Labeling; Synchronization; Video,Cameras; Labeling; Synchronization; Activity recognition; Annotating; Labor intensive; Multiple recordings; Multiple sensors; Video; Video and datum; Visual indicators; Data acquisition,Conference,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073520967

One such technology is the novel CO2-Binding Organic Liquid (CO2BOL) process developed at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The process utilizes their anhydrous CO2BOL solvent in place of amine mixtures to reduce the energy penalty. A full-scale model of this system based on NETL's Case 10 power plant is projected to produce 7-16% more net electric power over a traditional MEA system for the same plant. These full-scale model predictions are promising, however full-scale simulations are difficult to validate using only bench-scale data. There are errors in both the measurements and models that need to be considered in addition to uncertainties introduced by up-scaling. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is a statistical framework used to better understand these uncertainties as well as data gaps in models. By constraining models to data, distributions of model parameters are estimated and then propagated through the model to obtain distributions of key outputs such as carbon capture percent, energy penalty, stripper temperature, etc. The results from this UQ analysis aid the design of experiments (DoE) which identifies data gaps to fill to improve model accuracy. Using UQ and DoE effectively can reduce the development time of new carbon capture by years and save time and money on the path to a pilot, and ultimately full-scale, plant.

Little is known concerning the Coanda effect as it pertains to flame attachment in relation to wildfires. There is a need for improvement in the correlations between fire behavior on or near a slope and fire safety zones. An understanding of this effect could lead to more reliable guidelines for the establishment of firefighter safety zones, which are regions in wildfire areas that have been determined as safe for the survival of the firefighter. This paper discusses the ability of two commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes (Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and STAR-CCM+) to model the results of actual flame experiments near barren slopes. Simulation results were compared to measured values of flame attachment length and radiative and convective heat fluxes. Pressure and temperature gradient measurements along the slope are reported. Proper modeling of small-scale experiments with such software packages can lead to more confidence in large scale simulations and eventual development of firefighter safety zones in wildfires.",,Combustion; Computational fluid dynamics; Fire extinguishers; Fire fighting equipment; Fire protection; Computational Fluid Dynamics codes; Convective heat; Fire dynamics simulator; Gradient measurement; Large scale simulations; Pressure and temperature; Small-scale experiment; Wildland firefighter; Fires,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040167698

Predictive CFD simulations are valuable tools in evaluating and deploying oxy-fuel and other carbon capture technologies either as retrofit technologies or for new construction. However, accurate predictive combustor simulations require physically realistic submodels with low computational requirements. A recent sensitivity analysis of a detailed char conversion model (Char Conversion Kinetics (CCK)) found thermal annealing to be an extremely sensitive submodel. In the present work, further analysis of the previous annealing model revealed significant disagreement with numerous data sets from experiments performed after that annealing model was developed. The annealing model was accordingly extended to reflect experimentally observed reactivity loss due to thermal annealing of a variety of coals in diverse char preparation conditions. The model extension was informed by a Bayesian calibration analysis. Additionally, because oxy-fuel conditions include extraordinarily high levels of CO2, development of a first-ever CO2 reactivity loss model due to annealing is presented.",Char oxidation; Coal; Kinetics; Oxy-fuel; Sensitivity analysis,Annealing; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Computational fluid dynamics; Enzyme kinetics; Fuels; Sensitivity analysis; Bayesian calibration; Char oxidation; Computational requirements; Conversion kinetics; New constructions; Oxy-fuels; Preparation conditions; Thermal-annealing; Coal combustion,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040170850

Literature review suggests that particle size and number density play a more critical role in determination of radiative properties than the complex index of refraction. Radiative data was produced from numerical experiments using one of two particle distribution profiles (narrow or wide). A comparison of highly forward scattering cases for two particle sizes (25_m vs. 75_m) revealed a significant difference in incident heat flux maximum (25%). This difference was observed in both profiles examined. It was also generally observed that as particle size increases the difference between incident heat flux for forward and backward scattering decreases. No significant difference was observed between the large diffuse sphere and no scattering cases, suggesting that accurate modelling of larger particle size distributions can be achieved while neglecting scattering and phase functions. This result agrees with current practice in industry for air - coal mixtures. However, data suggests that phase function/scattering coefficient influence becomes more and more important with increasingly fine particle size.",,Coal; Coal industry; Forward scattering; Heat flux; Particle size; Refractive index; Complex index of refraction; Forward-and-backward; Numerical experiments; Oxy-coal combustions; Particle properties; Radiative heat fluxes; Radiative properties; Scattering phase function; Coal combustion,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040193214

To ensure appropriate combustion in the reactor, the feed system needed to maintain both a steady flow rate of gas and solids in the pipe and uniform distribution of solids through the cross-section of the channel. Steadiness was determined by the mass flow rate of the coal leaving the feed system. Uniformity was assessed by plotting gas and particle velocities at the end of the channel.

The code calculates gas temperature and composition, wall heat flux, and wall and refractory temperatures using 1D, equilibrium chemistry and a 3D discrete ordinates radiation solver. Chemistry and temperature calculations are made for a discrete number of axial zones wherein the temperature and species composition are assumed to be uniform. Radiation calculations are performed on a finer grid and assume gray gases. The code was validated by comparing to experimental data obtained from the L1500 Multifuel Furnace. The experimental data were taken from a single oxy-coal combustion experiment with flue gas recirculation run at a firing rate of 880kW and an air-fuel ratio of 3.6. FENICS was able to qualitatively match the wall flux and temperature profiles quite well. The major exception to this being that peak flux cannot accurately be predicted due the assumptions utilized 'smearing' the flame. Quantitatively, FENICS showed good agreement with the data. Wall temperatures were accurate to within 150K (13%) while total wall radiative heat loss was within 4%.

Recent work has presented in-system debug frameworks where instrumentation added to the design collects trace data as the circuit runs, and a software tool that allows the user to replay the execution using the captured data. When searching for the root cause of a bug, the designer may need to modify the instrumentation to collect data from a new part of the design, requiring a lengthy recompile. In this paper, we propose a flexible debug overlay family that provides software-like debug turn-around times for HLS generated circuits. At compile time, the overlay is added to the design and compiled. At debug time, the overlay can be configured many times to implement specific debug scenarios without a recompilation. This paper first outlines a number of ÒcapabilitiesÓ that such an overlay should have, and then describes architectural support for each of these capabilities.

While FPGAs provide a number of important benefits to cloud computing environments, they are susceptible to radiation-induced soft errors, which can lead to silent data corruption or system instability. Although soft errors within a single FPGA occur infrequently, soft errors in large-scale FPGAs systems can occur at a relatively high rate. This paper investigates the failure rate of several FPGA applications running within an FPGA cloud computing node by performing fault injection experiments to determine the susceptibility of these applications to soft-errors. The results from these experiments suggest that silent data corruption will occur every few hours within a 100,000 node FPGA system and that such a system can only maintain high-levels of reliability for short periods of operation.

Although simulations or software models can be used to explore the design space of these applications, often the final behaviour can not be evaluated until the design is mapped to the FPGA and integrated into the target system. This may be because long run-times are required, or because the environment can not be adequately described using a software model. Once unexpected behaviour is observed, on-chip debug is notoriously difficult; typically a design is instrumented with on-chip trace buffers that record the run-time behaviour for later interrogation. In this paper, we describe instrumentation that can accelerate the process of debugging machine learning applications implemented on an FPGA. Unlike previous work, our instrumentation is optimized to take advantage of characteristics of this application domain.

We here present observations and analyses of the M7.1 September 19, 2017, event that -while triggered by an intraplate rupture at approximately half the epicentral distance of the 1985 event relative to Mexico City -caused severe structural damage to a few tens of buildings located in a relatively narrow zone between the hill and lake zones of the basin, known as the transition zone. We show that the M 7.1 mainshock exposed the vulnerabilities of the pre-1985 building code in the transition zone; but more importantly highlighted the improvement of the 1987 building code revision in terms of the performance of modern high-rise buildings that suffered catastrophic consequences during the 1985 Michocan earthquake sequence. We next analyze several records collected at stations in the basin over the past 20 years.

No fatalities were reported, but the earthquake caused widespread power outages, structural damage to residential buildings, damage to roadways and railways, and ground failures. This paper presents a summary of preliminary findings by the NSF-sponsored Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) team. Damage was characterized using a combination of on-ground site mapping and aerial reconnaissance with state-of-art geomatics technology and photogrammetry. Recorded peak ground accelerations (PGA) at most stations range between 0.2 g and 0.3 g, with a few sites in the central and southeastern vicinities of Anchorage with PGA greater than 0.5 g. The duration of strong shaking from the M 7.1 event may not have been enough to initiate substantial movements on the majority of the historic landslides from the 1964 M 9.2 earthquake, including the slides at the Turnagain Heights and 4th Avenue. However, liquefaction appeared to have contributed to re-mobilization of the 1964 Potter Hill (Rabbit Creek) landslide. While the majority of the damage observed in Anchorage and surrounding communities appeared to be non-structural, the isolated cases of structural damage seemed to be caused by geotechnical issues, particularly settlement of the foundation and/or slope deformations. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Anchorages (foundations); Antennas; Earthquake engineering; Geotechnical engineering; Landslides; Outages; Structural analysis; Aerial reconnaissance; Alaska earthquakes; Moment magnitudes; Northridge earthquakes; Peak ground acceleration; Residential building; Slope deformation; Structural damages; Earthquakes,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081948655

Recent improvements in measuring suction provided the ability to make fast, accurate SWCCs in the lab but sample throughput drastically limits the number that can be produced. Collocating matric suction and water content sensors in situ would add many more SWCCs to the knowledge base. The objective of this study is to determine how well in situ generated SWCCs using a new, calibrated matric sensor compare to those created in the lab. Field and lab SWCCs compared quite well, but a few factors reduced their agreement. In coarser textured soils, living roots caused a divergence as the soil suction increased. Not surprisingly, intact core samples compared more favorably than disturbed. In finer textured soils, comparisons were favorable, but were also affected when laboratory samples were disturbed. Data suggest collocated in situ sensors could provide an important augmentation to laboratory data for developing a wide range of SWCCs. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

However, such methods are difficult to implement on routine projects without the use of specialized software because the many iterative probabilistic calculations required. Prior research has introduced a simplified approach of using performance-based reference parameter maps in conjunction with correction equations that account for site-specific geotechnical and topographical conditions. This paper addresses the development of such performance-based reference parameter maps for the calculation of post-liquefaction volumetric strains and settlements in the free field. A study is performed and presented to assess the optimized grid spacing for a performance-based volumetric strain analysis and development of a strain performance-based reference parameter map. Recommended grid spacing values as correlated to USGS seismic hazard maps for PGA are provided to produce a maximum of 0.15% strain error in interpolating the reference strain for the simplified performance-based analysis approach. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Earthquake engineering; Engineering geology; Geophysics; Geotechnical engineering; Hazards; Iterative methods; Soil mechanics; Strain; Uncertainty analysis; Correction equation; Performance based; Performance-based analysis; Performance-based earthquake engineering; Post-liquefaction; Reference parameters; Seismic hazard maps; Specialized software; Soil liquefaction,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048788179

Results of the study show that the sUAV/SfM approach estimates an average induced settlement of 38 cm across the site, which straddles within 2.5 cm of the average induced settlements that were measured with other traditional techniques. Additionally, the sUAV/SfM technique is shown to provide significant detail of the distribution of induced settlements across the site.

The goal of this study was to better understand this behavior for abutments backfilled with both gravel and geosynthetic reinforced soil (GRS). Large-scale testing was performed with non-skewed and 30¡ skewed abutment configurations. Two tests were performed at each skew angle, one with gravel backfill and one with GRS backfill. The test abutment backwall was 3.35 m wide, non-skewed, and 1.68 m high and loaded laterally into the backfill. Both backfills exhibited greater passive resistance than sand backfills owing to increased internal friction angle and unit weight. Skew angle reduced the passive force in both cases by about 40%. The GRS backfills had reduced initial stiffness and only reached 79% to 87% of the passive force developed by the unreinforced gravel backfill. This reduction was considered to be a result of reduced interface friction at the geotextile-backwall interface due to wrapping. Reduced stiffness may be favorable for abutment configurations because it allows thermal movement without developing excessive induced stresses in the bridge superstructure. © ASCE.",,Friction; Gravel; Reinforcement; Stiffness; Thermal expansion; Bridge superstructure; Expansion and contraction; Geosynthetic reinforced soils; Interface friction; Internal friction angle; Large scale testing; Passive resistance; Service conditions; Abutments (bridge),Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018771049

A geotechnical exploration, including boreholes, CPT soundings, and surface-based geophysical techniques, was performed to characterize the materials forming the wharf. The data and field observations are then analyzed and used to develop a geotechnical model of two cross-sections modeled in Plaxis2D, to conclude which is the most likely failure mechanism under a dynamic analysis. The results are compared against the deformations measured in a number cross sections of the wharf, suggesting that the failure can be explained by a combined effect of the dynamic increase in lateral earth pressures and the base rotation of the confining walls due to the lack of proper compaction of the rockfill prism below the confining walls. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",finite element modeling; Plaxis2D¨; quay wall; wharf,Earthquake engineering; Finite element method; Hydraulic structures; Quay walls; Soil liquefaction; Soil mechanics; Walls (structural partitions); Failure mechanism; Field observations; Geophysical techniques; Geotechnical exploration; Geotechnical modeling; Lateral earth pressure; Simplified evaluations; wharf; Earthquakes,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048744515

Because of the lack of large scale tests, there is almost no guidance for engineers in assessing the lateral resistance of piles located close to these MSE walls. The objective of this study was to assess lateral pile resistance as a function of distance from the wall face and predict force induced in the reinforcements. Full-scale lateral load tests were conducted on 24 piles located at 2, 3, 4, and 5 pile diameters behind 4.6 and 6-m high MSE walls. P-multipliers were developed to account for the decrease in lateral soil resistance. Little reduction occurred for piles located more than about 4 pile diameters from the wall. Measured tensile forces in the MSE reinforcements increased as the load on the pile increased and decreased rapidly with transverse distance from the direction of loading. Multiple linear regression equations were developed to predict maximum tensile force induced in reinforcing elements by lateral loading. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).All Rights Reserved.",,Linear regression; Loads (forces); Pile driving; Reinforcement; Retaining walls; Large scale tests; Lateral load tests; Lateral resistance; Maximum tensile force; Mechanically stabilized earth wall; Multiple linear regression equations; Reinforcing elements; Thermal variation; Piles,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048930595

The compressible material is typically expanded polystyrene or geofoam. Little guidance is available on the development of passive force with an inclusion. To explore this issue, large-scale passive force tests were conducted with and without a geofoam inclusion acting as a barrier between the backfill soil and a simulated bridge abutment. The presence of the geofoam inclusion reduced the passive force by 70% relative to the sand backfill alone. Although the measured force and failure geometry appeared to conform to a log-spiral mechanism when only sand backfill was used, the geofoam inclusion transforms the failure geometry to a Rankine failure mechanism. This suggests that the geofoam acted to reduce the interface friction between the wall and the backfill sand thereby reducing the passive resistance. © ASCE.",,Pressure distribution; Retaining walls; Compressible material; Expanded polystyrene; Failure mechanism; Geofoam inclusions; Interface friction; Large scale tests; Lateral earth pressure; Passive resistance; Abutments (bridge),Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018773829

The DPT consists of a 74 mm diameter cone tip driven by a 120 kg hammer with a free fall height of 100 cm. To expand the data base, DPT soundings were performed at the Pence Ranch and Larter Ranch sites where gravelly soil liquefied during the 1983 Mw6.9 Borah Peak earthquake. DPT testing was performed using an automatic hammer with the energy specified in the Chinese standard and with an SPT hammer.

In addition, LCC reduces the settlement of the underlying soils which is attractive to engineers. To evaluate the passive force-deflection curves for these materials, large-scale lab tests were performed with LCC and CLSM backfills in addition to a granular backfill for comparison. The response of the LCC was similar to that of the granular backfill with somewhat higher peak force developing at about 2.5% of the wall height. Although the stiffness was about twice as high as the granular backfill, the post-peak reduction was less than that for the granular fill. In contrast, the CLSM had a stiffness about 10 times higher than the granular fill and reached the peak value at a deflection equal to 1% of the wall height. The CLSM experienced a rapid decease in strength of about 60% after the peak strength was reached.

The annular space between the pile and the sleeve is typically filled with uncompacted pea gravel. Designers often assume that the lateral resistance of the pile within the sleeve will be minimal; however, no test results are available to confirm this assumption. To investigate the lateral resistance of piles driven within CMS, a full-scale lateral load test was performed. The test pile configuration included a 32.4 cm (12.75 in.) pipe pile within a 60 cm (24 in.) CMS with uncompacted pea gravel filling the annular space. Results indicate that after small pile displacements, the lateral pile resistance was similar to that provided by an individual pipe pile and was even greater at larger displacements. As the pile displaced laterally, the gravel within the annular space became engaged and displaced the CMS into the compacted fill. Back-analyses indicate that the ultimate lateral pile resistance for this case can be approximated by treating the pipe-gravel-CMS as a composite pile having an EI equal to the pipe pile but with a diameter equal to the CMS. © ASCE.",,Abutments (bridge); Corrugated metal; Gravel; Pile driving; Pile foundations; Annular space; Back analysis; Compacted fill; Composite piles; Lateral load tests; Lateral resistance; Pile displacement; Pipe piles; Piles,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048884022

The best experimental methodologies presented so far involve light transmission and thus only work for fiberglass reinforcements. An experimental methodology is presented in this paper, in which a proper lighting scheme allows for in situ photography of bubbles during liquid composite molding of carbon reinforcements. The resulting images were processed using image analysis software to identify key parameters such as grey level threshold, and size and circularity limits, which best allow for automated identification of bubbles in the images. No script achieved complete identification of all of the bubbles, but a methodology was developed and implemented to iterate the analysis parameters, evaluate the resulting bubble identification performance, and identify a range of analysis parameters that would provide the best possible results for automated in situ void detection. © 2017 International Committee on Composite Materials.

A majority of the participants felt more secure using Duo and felt it was easy to use. About half of all participants reported at least one instance of being locked out of their university account because of an inability to authenticate with Duo. We found that students and faculty generally had more negative perceptions of Duo than staff. The survey responses reveal some pain points for Duo users. In response, we offer recommendations that reduce the frequency of 2FA for users. We also suggest UI changes that draw more attention to 2FA methods that do not require WiFi, the 'Remember Me' setting, and the help utility. © 2019 IEEE.",Security; Two-factor authentication; Usability; Usable security,Felt; Surveys; Security; Two factor authentication; Usability; Usable security; User attitudes; Authentication,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071917366

In this paper, we present a framework for rateless physical-layer security codes over the wiretap channel by introducing both fixed and adaptive variants of rateless security coding schemes. These techniques can be used to reduce the requirements on CSI prior to code construction, because the codes will either adapt to the operating parameters of the legitimate user's channel on the fly and/or target a maximum allowable probability of intercept (POI) at the eavesdropper.

If enough random bits can be generated from CSI it becomes possible to uniquely map an arbitrary message to any symbol in the large QAM constellation.

It is assumed that separate Kalman filters are employed by each sensor and no measurements of known landmarks are available. Accurate bias estimation is achieved through the use of pseudo measurements of slant range from each sensor to the target and pseudo measurements of each sensor's bias. The covariance intersection (CI) algorithm is used to produce a pseudo measurement of slant range. This pseudo measurement of range allows pseudo measurements of sensor bias to be calculated based on each sensor's residuals and Kalman gains.

Here we present on the beginnings of our multi-pronged work to determine the origin, propagation, and distribution of Essential Tremor, and we provide preliminary results. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Patient treatment; Robotics; Surgery; Cerebellar ataxia; Essential tremor; In-vivo; Multiple research; Parkinson's disease; Quantitative characterization; Side effect; Surgical interventions; Low pass filters; electronic device; equipment design; essential tremor; human; pathophysiology; physiology; shoulder; signal processing; theoretical model; wrist; Equipment Design; Essential Tremor; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Shoulder; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Wearable Electronic Devices; Wrist",Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034812590

The method described utilizes a multi-objective fitness function together with custom, platform-specific metrics related to the dexterity and load-bearing capacity of inflatable manipulators. Candidate designs are scored by computing these metrics at many randomly generated configurations and then by appropriately combining these scores within the multi-objective optimization framework. High performing designs are propagated through a genetic algorithm. The final result is a set of diverse, optimal designs lying along a Pareto front spanning the design space. By examining variations and trade-offs within this set, a designer can more appropriately choose design parameters for a target application.

During the optimization routine, the manipulator's base position and joint motions are planned simultaneously by strategically moving a set of virtual robot arms (each representing a single configuration in a sequence) branching from a common base to a number of assigned target poses associated with a task. Additional goals (e.g. collision avoidance) and hard constraints, including joint limits are also incorporated. The optimization problem at the core of this method is a quadratic program, allowing constrained high-dimensional problems to be solved in very little time.

This extends the operational life of the robot by decreasing long term error during operation by as much as 50% of the steady state error at the end effector when compared to the same leak if our adaptation method is not used.

Power system models have a number of features that makes their improvement challenging - they are multi-level, multi-user and multi-physics. Not surprisingly, they are nonlinear and time varying, both in terms of states (memory variables) and parameters, and discrete structures, such as graphs, are strongly blended with continuous dynamics, resulting in network dynamics. The transient stability models are used as a prototypical example. Our method is based on information geometry, and uses advances in computational differential geometry to characterize high-dimensional manifolds in the space of measurements. In the case of network parameters, a comparison is presented with circuit-theoretic techniques.

The method is applied to impact loading investigations of a stiffened composite skin panel. The reflected spectrum of each FBG in an array, embedded in the panel, is collected at 100 kHz during the impact events with a spectral resolution down to 40 pm. Visualization of the FBG responses to these impact events, including the presence of spectral distortion in some FBG spectra, is presented.

Recently, there has been increased interest in Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) security keys-small hardware devices that require users to press a button on the security key to authenticate. To examine the usability of security keys in non-enterprise usage, we conducted two user studies of the YubiKey, a popular line of U2F security keys. The first study tasked 31 participants with configuring a Windows, Google, and Facebook account to authenticate using a YubiKey. This study revealed problems with setup instructions and workflow including users locking themselves out of their operating system or thinking they had successfully enabled 2FA when they had not. In contrast, the second study had 25 participants use a YubiKey in their daily lives over a period of four weeks, revealing that participants generally enjoyed the experience.

To assess the secrecy level of the proposed scheme, three types of decoding strategies are evaluated: a matching decoder which knows the positions of all inserted bits inside the blocklength and tries to estimate them using the same decoding techniques, a blind decoder which treats all the frozen bits as the same value, and a random decoder which considers those dynamic bits as random at the receiver. Results are presented in terms of the system security gap, assuming an adaptive decoding strategy. It is shown that the system achieves combined secrecy and reliability.

This development is a critical component for enabling fixed-wing aircraft to use a novel methodology called relative navigation. Relative navigation allows a single vehicle to gracefully accommodate intermittent GPS or geo-registered image updates. It can also enable communication and a computationally feasible cooperative, batch-based navigation approach for numerous vehicles. This paper presents a visual-odometry estimator that is appropriate for fixed-wing flight characteristics and sensing requirements. We propose a modification to the multi-state-constraint Kalman filter which, instead of running the filter in a single inertial/global frame, regularly resets the navigation frame to a new local origin. The vehicle operates based on the most recent keyframe and produces a marginalized change in pose (odometry) and covariance output whenever the keyframe is updated. This allows the front end to operate at the IMU rate to accommodate guidance and control inputs while sharing marginalized keyframe-to-keyframe odometry estimates with a back-end, graph optimization at a much lower rate than traditional batch navigation schemes. Results from testing the proposed method in a high-fidelity simulation of the filter is also presented. © 2018 IEEE.",,Air navigation; Cooperative communication; Global positioning system; Kalman filters; Navigation; Critical component; Graph optimization; Guidance and control; High-fidelity simulations; Monocular cameras; Novel methodology; Registered images; Relative navigation; Fixed wings,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048870163

Project-based learning is designed to provide students with an opportunity to engage in authentic problem finding and solving. Students often become very involved with the specifics of their project without always noticing what they are learning. As such, it becomes essential to engage them in reflection during the process and at the completion of the project. A constellation of formative and summative assessment activities that include self, group, and instructor, can aid the learner in this contemplation. We propose that public assessment in the form of a student-run sale can provide distinctive feedback to students. Our experience with student-run retail sales over multiple years has lead us to identify some unique characteristics of this type of public assessment. These include a positive effect on student motivation, independent validation in a face-to-face setting, and providing direct consumer feedback to students.

The educational goal is for students to gain confidence in their ability to gather insights through interviews, observations, and participatory experiences; simplify this data down to a handful of experience drivers; and use these drivers to create a framework that provides new insight for the more mature design exploration required in the third-year studios. The introduction of this skill earlier than immediately necessary brings tradeoffs.

To increase student engagement with design history and discourse, we prototyped a new format for our design history course in Brigham Young UniversityÕs Industrial Design department. Our goal was to enable students to process designs they encounter, both in person and social media, through a critical and cultural perspective, and then turn those lenses towards their own design work with greater social and cultural awareness. To do this, we utilized Instagram as the primary platform (@byudesignhistory) for course discussion and altered the way we framed student assignments. This new curriculum was prototyped in the spring of 2018. Outcomes were measured by monitoring student engagement, responses, and comprehension scores on verbal and written assignments and examinations. Students also responded to a series of reviews to gather their perspectives on the class. Results indicate an increase in their understanding of the cultural position design holds in a way that was absent in student results from the previous course structure. If our course interventions are effective, students should move from concrete to abstract knowledge as well as from lower order to higher order thinking skills. Students will thus be better prepared to assess, understand and discuss both current and historical design cultures and trends while influencing their own design work through an informed perspective. © 2018 Institution of Engineering Designers The Design Society.

As project complexity increases, students are faced with information overload and can struggle to move forward in a meaningful way. Complex Problem Solving studies and Cognitive Load Theory suggest information reduction as a way to grasp the critical aspects of a problem and move beyond the impasse inherent with too much information. Segmentation and chunking are common strategies for information reduction but the abstraction inherent in the chunking process provides better conceptual understanding. The simplified but meaningful results from the chunking process can then be leveraged to create a model or framework that helps students organise and clarify what they have observed as well as point to new opportunities for design activity. Despite the fear of oversimplification, significantly abstracted models have great Òexplanatory or predictive powerÓ and can lead to rich results. Reviewing the concepts of complexity, cognitive load, and contrasting segmentation with data chunking, this paper will then highlight a portion of a student project where information reduction provided understanding beyond initial student impressions and encouraged them to move forward. © 2018 Institution of Engineering Designers The Design Society.

It was developed to establish suitable teaching practice to educate students on efficient design methods in a distributed product realisation projects in conjunction with an industrial partner. Students work in international teams formed from multiple partner universities. Communication is primarily through video-conferencing and other synchronous and asynchronous means of communication to perform design tasks including the vision, conceptual design, detail design and prototyping. Students ultimately meet during the final workshop at the end of the course to assemble and test prototypes and to disseminate their work to the company and wider public. The CODEVE methodology was tested in the Erasmus+ funded project called Networked Activities for Realisation of Innovative Products (NARIP) from 2015-2107. It has been implemented in academic institution in Europe. This paper discusses applicability of this methodology in the project which connects universities and industry across the Atlantic. Three universities are participating this year: Brigham Young University from Utah, USA with Industrial Design students, University of Technology and Economics of Budapest in Hungary with product design students and City, University of London from the UK with mechanical, aeronautical and electrical engineering students. The industrial partner is Black Diamond, a global company based in Utah, USA, while the manufacturing of prototypes and final workshop are hosted at City, University of London. Time difference, culture and the discipline of study make implementation of CODEVE methodology in this transatlantic project more difficult than if the project is kept within European Universities.

However, if their observations and knowledge are not soon applied, the students hold only fond memories of a fun trip abroad. We believe that studentÕs retention and application of concepts will increase if educators give students greater autonomy on the trip and also expect and enable opportunities to apply their accrued knowledge on their own projects upon returning home. Nine third and fourth-year industrial design students Brigham Young University participated in a weeklong field study abroad to Dutch Design Week (DDW) in Eindhoven, Netherlands. A week after the completion of the study abroad the students filled out a survey about their motivations, feelings, criticisms, and aspects of the trip that influenced them as designers. Three and a half months later the students took a second survey asking about how they have applied insights gained from participation in DDW to their current projects. The results from the both surveys suggest the impact of the field study trip decreased over time. The observations and more open-ended questions in the survey helped determine if and how the students applied their conceptual knowledge to their current projects as well as other outcomes of the trip.

We have observed that in successful teams, the education and skills of team members matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work and view their contributions. We believe that there are distinct and innate differences between students in different academic disciplines when it comes to moral positions and these differences in worldview inherently causes friction in interdisciplinary teams. Consequently, we feel that if students could understand these differences extrinsically, they could potentially improve their experience within their interdisciplinary team work. We ran a pilot study with students from Brigham Young University comparing the industrial design, engineering and entrepreneurship majors using The Moral Foundations Questionnaire (Graham, Haidt & Nosek, 2008) This survey measures five facets of oneÕs moral position: Care/Harm, Fairness/Reciprocity, In-group/Loyalty, Authority/Respect and Sanctity/Purity. Results show that designers scored higher in liberal values than their more conservative leaning engineering and business student counterparts. These results support our hypothesis. Understanding the fundamental value differences between disciplinary training should reduce friction and enhance interdisciplinary team communication. This ability to appreciate other mindsets in order to communicate and effectively design with individuals from differing disciplines will be an Òessential skill for workers in the coming decadesÓ (Colombo and Grilli, 2005). © 2019 Institution of Engineering Designers, The Design Society.

This study is inspired by existing play studies that continue to demonstrate the positive relationship between the freedom to be playful and psychological wellbeing. The methods used in this study include a consolidation of 99 anonymous free-response student surveys over the course of six semesters that are organised in terms of stress level and frustration word indicators. These comments provide a historical baseline for understanding the student perceptions of their classroom learning experience as it relates to their emotional wellbeing. We then compare those comments with comments made after a semester of playful interventions to discover how they differ. The results indicate that levels of ÒstressÓ and ÒfrustrationÓ were decreased with playful interventions, however students spent more hours outside of class lecture on their assignments and the overall student course rating nominally decreased. These results are discussed as well as how pedagogical changes to traditional classroom environments such as this may not only impact stress and frustration but also significantly contribute to the holistic learning experience for university students. © 2019 Institution of Engineering Designers, The Design Society.

This year we explored further integration of Instagram as an academic tool. This study included twenty-two undergraduate participants who prototyped five new classroom uses of Instagram: posting full student presentations, utilising Instagram desktop view as the primary in-class presentation tool, employing templates enabling a cohesive visual identity and a simple search process, and methods to enhance student comments. We surveyed course participants mid-semester asking students about their personal Instagram use, the value and purpose they felt Instagram had in the course, and on the usefulness of the presentation templates. We learned that while the majority of students use Instagram in their daily life, few of them make comments on personal or course posts and will only do so for credit. We also learned that while students might not enjoy using Instagram in the course, they find it of value and highly meaningful. Finally, the students prefer using formatted templates over an open style like PowerPoint to build their presentations in. These templates enabled the students to post their full presentations and created a visual cohesiveness for the account while providing a rudimentary search process for individual posts. We will continue using Instagram in future courses with the exception of requiring comments. We believe that students will reference their class posts in years to come, and as they do, it will re-enforce their design knowledge and provide evidence of their personal growth. © 2019 Institution of Engineering Designers, The Design Society.

New fiber optic sensors with ruggedized construction and non-electrical components are subjected to accelerated aging tests and deployed in several installations with long service life. An overview of current progress with fiber optic technology is provided for fatigue monitoring, temperature, pressure, and strain sensing. Recent developments include improved service life, novel bonding methods, pipeline sensor station improvements, sensor calibration, and long-term fatigue analysis. The latest advancements are validated on multiple installations on a subsea tieback in the deepwater Mississippi Canyon of the Gulf of Mexico at 6, 500 ft depth. A prior third-party sensor design experienced multiple non-recoverable sensor failures. A new sensor station design is employed on two Flowline Terminations to monitor pressure and temperature at a rate of 100 Hz. Subsea tiebacks are susceptible to flow assurance issues caused by plugging events such as hydrate formation. The system was originally designed to track pig location but transitioned to pressure and temperature sensing. An issue with the transition was the lack of calibration relating the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) strain levels to the actual process conditions. A novel method is presented for in situ adjustment of the sensor array calibration. During the calibration procedure, the sensors produced unanticipated results during pipeline flow shut-in and later startup operations. The sensors helped uncover a configuration of the flowline and sensor locations that is valuable for detecting hydrate forming conditions at a key junction location. The sensors are located before and after the junction of two flowlines in the mixing zone of the pipeline streams. The novel contributions of this study are the high speed data collection, in situ fiber optic calibration, review of advancements in fiber optic sensing technology, and a field case study with multiple sensing arrays. The developments are part of the Clear Gulf study, a collaboration between the offshore energy industry and NASA that was formed in 2010. The objective of the Clear Gulf study is to employ space technology and testing facilities for use in the upstream industry to advance subsea sensor technology. The highly sensitive monitoring systems developed as part of this study are used to give early warnings for flow assurance issues, structural failures, or catastrophic events.

(Ref: OMAE2017-61494 Development and Testing of a Friction-Based Post-Installable Sensor for Subsea FiberOptic Monitoring Systems [1]). The prototype fiber-optic monitoring system collects a wide range of real-time data, which can be used to determine structural loading, fatigue, temperature, pressure, and flow assurance on operational platforms. The primary challenge of a post-installed instrumentation monitoring system is to ensure secure coupling between the sensors and the structure of interest for reliable measurements. Friction-based coupling devices have the potential to overcome installation challenges caused by marine growth and soil contamination on subsea structures, flowlines, or risers. This particular design solution is compatible with structures that are suspended in the water column and those that are resting on the seabed. In addition, the system can be installed by commercial divers in shallow depths or by remotely operated vehicles in deep-water applications. Operational limitations of the initial design concept were identified in the previous series of tests (2016-2017), and several innovative enhancements have been implemented which resulted in significant improvements in sensor system coupling and strain measurement correlation with traditional strain measuring devices. This paper provides a summary of the notable prototype design changes, full-scale test article buildup, and detailed performance data recorded during tension and compression loading that simulated representative offshore conditions. The test results were positive and demonstrated the effectiveness of the design enhancements. Compromises made during mounting of the sensing elements resulted in better performance in tension than compression. These effects are well understood and are fully discussed, and do not influence the viability of the design changes. This study is part of a continuing collaboration between the Houston-based NASA-Johnson Space Center and Astro Technology, Inc. within a study called Clear Gulf. The primary objective of the Clear Gulf study is to develop advanced instrumentation technologies that will improve operational safety and reduce the risk of hydrocarbon spillage. NASA provided unique insights, expansive test facilities, and technical expertise to advance these technologies that would benefit the environment, the public, and commercial industries.

However, when using monolithic thick-sheet materials for these types of mechanisms, accommodating the thickness proves challenging. One approach to solve this is to create compliant mechanisms along the fold lines that inherently store energy when actuated and causes the mechanism to tend toward its low energy state. This tendency can be used to create bistable states. We outline a method to use this stored energy to achieve bistable states and name the resulting mechanism an origami-based ""Thickness-accommodating bistable interior vertex"" (TABIV) in monolithic thick-sheet materials. The kinematics and energy-displacement relationships of this mechanism are derived. Prototypes are shown to exhibit the predicted bistable behavior and the mechanism is integrated and prototyped into origami-based mechanisms demonstrating advantageous multi-stable behaviors. © 2018 IEEE.",,Mechanisms; Bi-stable state; Bistable mechanisms; Bistables; Large structures; Low-energy state; Multistable; Stored energy; Thick sheets; Compliant mechanisms,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053888702

In this paper, vehicle search paths are dictated by a joint cost function which maximizes the reward earned from partitioned sections across the search area. In previous work, these rewards were assigned based on the elapsed time since the section had last been searched. This approach is effective in rewarding vehicles to search out areas which haven't been visited in a long time, yet it lacks the ability to weight grid cells differently based on the probability that targets will be in that section. This paper proposes a method of using accumulated knowledge of the average density of targets within an area, along with a Gaussian process regression to assign rewards. Vehicles then choose paths that are more likely to find targets rather than seeking areas which have not been searched recently. Through numerical simulations we show that this method increases the number of targets seen by cooperating UAVs and provides an accurate estimate of target density within a search area. © 2018 IEEE.",,Cost functions; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Numerical methods; Cooperating vehicles; Gaussian process regression; Grid cells; Mission objectives; Search area; Search parameters; Target density; Vehicle searches; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV),Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053876914

The system was trained to recognize the seven gestures and then tested in a hardware-in-the-loop simulation. The system was able to identify all gestures with an overall accuracy of 90% and with five of the seven gestures being accurately identified at least 94% of the time.

Structures comprised of origami tessellations offer a means to achieve angular cavities that approach black-like behavior during collapse by exploiting use of the cavity effect. Expanded origami surfaces exhibit intrinsic radiative properties while collapsed surfaces exhibit increasingly black-like behavior as the cavity aspect ratio increases. Actuation of such surfaces provides the means to achieve any apparent radiative behavior between these two extremes. This work explores the use of three origami structures (finite V-groove, hinged V-groove and Miura-ori) and their respective apparent radiative properties as a function of cavity geometry using Monte Carlo ray tracing. Results are presented as a function of tessellation geometry and degree of actuation (i.e. collapse). Ray tracing models are benchmarked with V-groove geometries for which analytical models exist in the literature. Convergence for ray independence was determined to be satisfactory when the standard error of the mean for every test case was less than 0.005. Deviation in the apparent absorptivity for finite V-groove relative to the infinite V-groove is quantified. The apparent absorptivity of the Miura-ori fold exhibits sensitivity to the fold geometry when the angle of the unit cell is varied, but is relatively insensitive to the length ratio of the panel. The variable nature of the net radiative heat transfer, achievable through actuation, affords a method for thermal management of components with variable heat dissipation and/or variable radiative environments. © 2018 International Heat Transfer Conference.

These more realistic interactions, which we model as a form of stochastic game called interaction games (IGs), have attributes which prohibit the straightforward application of many often-used algorithms developed for RGs.

We introduce a heuristic algorithm to dynamically compute information-disclosure policies for the entrepreneur, followed by an empirical evaluation to demonstrate its competitiveness over the widely-adopted immediate-disclosure policy. Our results demons trate that the immediate-disclosure policy is not optimal when backers follow thresholding policies despite its ease of implementat ion.

However, a clear measure of influence with respect to leader position is not adequately studied. Studies with animal systems have shown that leaders who exert strong couplings may be located in front, where they provide energy benefits, or in the middle, where they can be seen by a larger section of the group. In this paper, we systematically vary number of leaders and leader positions in simulated robotic swarms of two different sizes, and assess their effect on steering effectiveness and energy expenditure. In particular, we analyze the effect of placing leaders in the front, middle, and periphery, on the time to converge and lateral acceleration of a swarm of robotic agents as it performs a single turn to reach the desired goal direction. Our results show that swarms with leaders in the middle and periphery take less time to converge than swarms with leaders in the front, while the lateral acceleration between the three placement strategies is not different. We also find that the time to converge towards the goal direction reduces with the increase in percentage of leaders in the swarm, although this value decays slowly beyond the percentage of leaders at 30%. As the swarm size is increased, we find that the leaders in the periphery become less effective in reducing the time to converge. Finally, closer analysis of leader placement and coverage reveals that front leaders within the swarm tend to expand their coverage and move towards the center as the maneuver is performed. Results from this study are expected to inform leader placement strategies towards more effective human swarm interaction systems. © Copyright 2017, International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (www.ifaamas.org).

While the individual masonry components can be considered isotropic at the material level, masonry assemblages are anisotropic at the structural level. These properties of masonry make it difficult to develop models that accurately describe the material behavior for all analysis and design scenarios. One analysis tool that is efficient and reliable is the use of stress fields. Stress fields are based on the lower-bound theorem of the theory of plasticity. Stress fields have been combined with the truss analogy to produce what is known as the strut-and-tie modelling procedure. This article presents ongoing research that has the objective to develop strut-and-tie modelling procedures for masonry. The presented methodology uses the existing strut-and-tie guidelines for reinforced concrete as starting point and applies that methodology to the modelling of several masonry shear walls with openings. The shear strength predictions from the proposed strut-and-tie modelling methodology are shown to perform well compared to the experimental strengths. This is associated with the ability of the strut-and-tie modelling procedure to account for the geometric particularities of each wall. © 2018 The International Masonry Society (IMS).",Limit analysis; Masonry shear-wall; Masonry structures; Numerical modelling; Strut-and-tie model,Indexing; Bit error rate; Block codes; Channel estimation; Curve fitting; Errors; Information theory; Mean square error; Space time codes; Space-time block coding (STBC); Telemetering; Telemetering equipment; Aeronautical telemetry; Bit error rate (BER) performance; Curve fitting algorithm; Greedy algorithms; Mean squared error; Minimum mean squared error equalizers; Optimum power allocations; Signaltonoise ratio (SNR); Equalizers;Numerical models; Reinforced concrete; Shear walls; Limit analysis; Lower bound theorem; Masonry shear walls; Masonry structures; Modelling methodology; Shear strength predictions; Strut-and-tie model; Theory of plasticity; Stresses,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062312486

This reduces the cost of specialty laborers and the variability in construction that exists from the application of mortar. Several dry-stack systems exist and can be subcategorized as interlocking systems or surface bonded systems. In interlocking systems, the blocks are connected by their geometry while in surface bonded systems the blocks are connected by a structural coating applied to the surface of the wall. This article describes a finite element model that can be used to predict the in-plane capacity and behavior of dry-stack masonry walls with a surface coating. Four walls were built and tested for their in-plane shear capacity. Two walls were unreinforced and ungrouted and two walls were reinforced and grouted at 1.22 m both vertically and horizontally. The results of these tests were used to validate the finite element model. The finite element model was developed using VecTor2. The numerical response is in good agreement to measured response. For the ungrouted unreinforced walls, the calculated maximum load was within 4% and 14% of the measured maximum loads. For the reinforced and grouted walls, the calculated maximum load was within 8% and 1% of the measured maximum loads. © 2018 The International Masonry Society (IMS).",Dry-stack; Finite element model; In-plane shear capacity; Masonry,Data processing; Coatings; Concrete construction; Grouting; Mortar; Reinforcement; Safety devices; Walls (structural partitions); Bonded systems; In-plane shear; Interlocking systems; Masonry; Masonry shear walls; Numerical response; Stack systems; Surface coatings; Finite element method,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062311464

Two mortars were tested, with volume proportions of cement, lime and sand of 1:0.5:4 and 1:1:6. Two specimen heights, 50 and 140 mm, with diameter of 45 mm, resulting in diameter/height ratios of 1.0 and 0.3, respectively were used. The experimental results indicated that the confinement and strength of the mortar influence its stress-strain behavior: the larger the confinement, the more the non-linear behavior. In addition, the results indicated that the Poisson's ratio and the tangent modulus of elasticity vary with increasing applied load. A numerical model was developed that accounted for the observations from the experimental phase with a nonlinear elastic phased analysis, which updates the modulus of elasticity and the Poisson's ratio at each new phase. The tangent modulus of elasticity was calculated directly from the experimental results while the Poisson's ratio was approximated using the model proposed by Ottosen.

While most individuals recover fully from mild injuries within weeks, some continue to experience symptoms including headaches, disrupted sleep, and other cognitive, behavioral or physical symptoms. Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) shows promise in identifying areas of structural disruption and predicting outcomes. Although some studies suggest widespread structural disruption after brain injury, dMRI studies of military brain injury have yielded mixed results so far, perhaps due to the subtlety of mild injury, individual differences in injury location, severity and mechanism, and co-morbidity with other disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and substance abuse. We present preliminary dMRI results from the ENIGMA (Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) military brain injury working group. We found higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in participants with a history of TBI.

For the cases considered in this paper, it was found that: 1/ the l-distribution approach is more accurate than Ck methods and can be used as the reference; 2/ the RC-SLW model provides very accurate predictions; 3/ the WSGG technique, which is the fastest method considered in this work, provides acceptable estimations, even in highly non-isothermal situations. © Begell House Inc. 2020.",,,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075251450

Two versions of the full-spectrum CK (FSCK) model, the Rank-Correlated full-spectrum kdistribution/ Spectral-Line-Weighted-sum-of-gray-gases (RC FSK/SLW) and a new version of the Weighted-Sum-of-Grey-Gases (WSGG) model are compared with the Narrow-Band CK (NBCK) model in four turbulent axisymmetric jet diffusion flames fueled either by hydrogen or methane at atmospheric and higher pressures. As a first step, these comparisons are performed in decoupled radiative heat transfer calculations with the thermal fields being prescribed. The databases and coefficients associated to these different models are determined from a unique Line-By-Line database in order to allow a relevant comparison. Model results suggest that the SLW/FSK methods coupled to the Cai's scheme (JQSRT 141 (2014) 65-92) or the Rank-Correlated spectrum (JQSRT 214 (2018) 120-32) and databases generated from accurate LBL database are the most mature gas radiative property models to be implemented in CFD code dealing with combustion problems involving complex geometry and gas-soot mixtures. © Begell House Inc. 2020.",,,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073147837

In the considered configuration, a jet flame issues from a central nozzle into a vitiated coflow of hot combustion products from an array of lean H2/air flames. Centreline profiles for mixture fraction, temperature and mass fraction of O2 and OH obtained from ODT simulations with a planar and cylindrical formulation are shown and compared to measurements from Cabra et al. (2005). Additionally, two-dimensional renderings of the jet flame and scatter plots of temperature versus mixture fraction and OH mass fraction versus mixture fraction are provided. Although the application of ODT for reactive flows in jet configurations is not novel, the chosen lifted jet flame in a vitiated coflow represents a challenge for the model. The accurate representation of the subtle interactions of the hot coflow products with the cold unburnt jet flow are crucial for the reaction and autoignition of the jet (Cabra et al., 2005).

It is well known, however, that in practice there is no such thing as a universal compression algorithm; thus, some statistical information about the plaintext tends to survive the compression process. In this paper, we consider Lempel-Ziv Welch compression and analyze its effectiveness in removing statistical information from English plaintext. Specifically, we present several techniques for exploiting the structure of the compression algorithm to launch a successful statistical attack on compressed and encrypted data. All attacks are ciphertext only, and one of them relies on linear programming. Although our attacks indicate that an eavesdropper may require additional ciphertext to carry out a successful attack if compression is used, the specific adaptive nature of the Lempel-Ziv compression technique leaves its own statistics on the message, which can be exploited by an attacker. © 2018 IEEE.",,Channel coding; Linear programming; Security of data; Signal encoding; Statistics; Wireless telecommunication systems; Adaptive natures; Compression algorithms; Compression encoding; Compression process; Compression techniques; Statistical attacks; Statistical information; Universal compression; Cryptography,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056700920

For a 30 kHz frequency offset and a 10 Mbit/s 16-APSK signal, the conventional phase lock loop (PLL) system does not achieve consistent lock to be a useful approach. Consequently, a blind feed-forward approach, based on the FFT, and an initialized feedback approach based on the PLL were examined. The feed-forward estimator is capable of achieving BER ideal performance for Eb/N0 ³ 6 dB using 1024 symbols. The feedback estimator, initialized using a feed-forward estimate based on 1024 symbols is also capable of achieving BER ideal performance for Eb/N0 ³ 6 dB.

Recent work has extended the crystallographic reconstruction of parent austenite in steels to include the reconstruction of special boundaries, such as annealing twins. These reconstructions present unique challenges, as twinned austenite grains share a subset of possible daughter variant orientations. This gives rise to regions of ambiguity in a reconstruction. A technique for the reconstruction of twin boundaries is presented here that is capable of reconstructing 60¡ <1 1 1> twins, even in the case where twin regions are comprised entirely of variants that are common between the twin and the parent. This technique is demonstrated in the reconstruction of lath martensitic steels. The reconstruction method utilizes a delayed decision-making approach, where a chosen orientation relationship is used to define all possible groupings of daughter grains into possible parents before divisive decisions are made. These overlapping, inclusive groupings (called clusters) are compared to each other individually using their calculated parent austenite orientations and the topographical nature of the overlapping region. These comparisons are used to uncover possible locations of twin boundaries present in the parent austenite.

Field investigations showed that it occurs in diverse geographic locations around the U.S. and is a source of continued maintenance concern for railroads. Water appeared to be a significant factor involved in concrete bottom tie abrasion. Ballast fouling, center-binding cracking, rail surface profile variations, and large track movement during loading was seen in locations with concrete bottom tie abrasion. Bumps or track stiffness changes were often found at locations of abrasion damage. Specifically, some locations with known stiff track conditions exhibited significant abrasion damage.

A relevant question in control engineering education is: How to close the gap between theory and practice? Once subjects are introduced in theoretical classes, students want to know about its practical use. Thus, it is important to introduce theoretical control concepts with practical experiments, enabling students to easily test and validate the theory. An Arduino based temperature control laboratory (TCLab) is deployed in this study as a portable kit providing students with a simple and effective means to test some feedback control techniques.

Coronary stents currently have two major complications: restenosis and thrombosis. CI-CNT stents may provide improved clinical outcomes for both of these issues. Multiple stent design concepts were generated, evaluated, and two stent designs were selected: one with a semi-auxetic nature, and one designed for maximum force. These designs were further developed and optimized using analytical tools along with finite element analysis. Planar versions of the stent designs were manufactured and mechanically tested to verify performance. The performance of the cylindrical stent configurations was analyzed using finite element modeling. A sample cylindrical stent was also fabricated. This research demonstrates that feasible coronary stent designs can be manufactured from CI-CNTs.

A typical value is Q = 2500, but can be even higher. These high values of Q can be obtained at very low frequencies, solving a long-standing problem for LC tank circuits. The new configuration consists of one voltage divider phase shift filter nested within a second such filter.

Surface strains were measured using a digital image correlation method in order to ensure that biaxial stretching was achieved. The punch height versus load curve was found to be the same for temperatures of 25 and for 50, ¡C, while at 75, ¡C the load for a given punch height was less. This difference seems to indicate a change in deformation mechanism between 50 and 75, ¡C. Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) was used to quantify features of the microstructure in the as-received and the strained specimens. Rather than a sudden transition from twinning to slip at low temperatures, it appears that twinning gradually decreases and slip activity increases as temperatures rise across the range from 25 to 125, ¡C. This confirms recent predictions found in the literature.

When a model of a power system is to be compared with measurements taken at discrete times, it can be interpreted as a mapping from parameter space into a data or prediction space. Generically, model mappings can be interpreted as manifolds with dimensionality equal to the number of structurally identifiable parameters. Empirically it is observed that model mappings often correspond to bounded manifolds. We propose a new definition of practical identifiability based the topological definition of a manifold with boundary. In many ways, our proposed definition extends the properties of structural identifiability. We construct numerical approximations to geodesics on the model manifold and use the results, combined with insights derived from the mathematical form of the equations, to identify combinations of practically identifiable and unidentifiable parameters. We give several examples of application to dynamic power systems models. © 2018 IEEE.",Computational differential geometry; Manifold boundary approximation method; Model reduction; Parameter identifiability; Power system modeling; System identification,Computational geometry; Identification (control systems); Mapping; Boundary approximation methods; Computational differential geometry; Model reduction; Parameter identifiability; Power system model; Parameter estimation,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061821031

However, many utilities have not historically tracked all of the elements of water main break data. One factor used to quantify the occurrences of failing underground pipe networks is water main break rates. Water main break rates are calculated for all pipe materials used in water delivery to create a measurement to judge pipe performance and durability. Water main break rates can vary year to year and by utility. However, in aggregate, break rates produce a compelling story which can aid our prudent decision making as it relates to repairing and replacing our underground pipes. In April 2012, Utah State University published an initial comprehensive survey of water utilities. This was a survey of water main breaks and operating characteristics at utilities located in U.S. and Canada. Six years later in 2018, a new water main break study was released reviewing the national metric for citizens served per one mile of pipe, aggregate data on pipe material break rates, the analysis of age and corrosion in failure modes, and related observations on pressure, delivery volumes, effects of soil corrosivity, and trenchless technology practices. This paper reviews the newest water main break study metrics and findings and outlines various trends and projections of water main breaks in the U.S. and Canada which can be used to benchmark an organization's water main breaks and use this critical data in asset management plans. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Aggregates; Asset management; Decision making; Pipeline corrosion; Pipelines; Slip forming; Surveys; Underground corrosion; Water supply; Asset management plan; Operating characteristics; Replacement projects; Soil corrosivity; Trenchless technologies; Underground pipes; Utah state universities; Water industries; Trenching,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063460461

GIS (geographic information system) helps to empower a utility with the tools to drive a robust and strategic, decision making process. When a CMMS (computerized maintenance management system) has asset management functionality, the capabilities of service requests, inspections and work orders, capturing costs, and work history can be leveraged into asset condition and risk-based spatial analysis by determining what, when, why, and where the next round of investment should occur. A critical step in the process includes analyzing the data and location to potential take actions to reduce the risks. In alignment with ISO (International Standards Organization) 55000, risk is defined as the probability of failure (PoF) multiplied by the consequence of failure (CoF) which produces the business risk exposure (BRE). While calculating risk is important, the risk-based data can be used to build business cases and determine future projects. GIS can help users gain an understanding of what assets are high risk, where they are located and what factor can influence the risk. Risk-based analysis provides the reasoning for potential solutions and action.

Sustainability concerns apply to many critical resources such as water. On a per capita basis, the U.S. leads the world in water usage, with a substantial portion of water consumed/leaked by infrastructure systems. Because of water availability, competing water demands, and changing hydrologic conditions, the U.S. Department of Interior predicts that multiple water conflicts will occur in the western U.S. by 2025. In addition, decades of excessive demands on ecological systems have reduced their capacities to absorb and process emissions and wastes. Sustainable water infrastructure is vital to providing the American public with clean and safe water and helping to ensure the environmental, economic, and social health of the nation's communities. The increasing interest in sustainability has led to the development of sustainability assessment tools such as life cycle assessments (LCA) analyzing the embodied energy and environmental impacts. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool used to identify the environmental impacts of a product, process, or activity over the entire lifespan of the product. LCA studies also quantify and interpret the environmental flows to and from the environment (including emissions to air, water, and land, as well as the consumption of energy and other material resources) over the entire life cycle of a product (or process or service). By including the impacts throughout the product life cycle, LCA provides a comprehensive view of the environmental aspects of the product and an accurate picture of the true environmental tradeoffs in product selection. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Environmental impact; Global warming; Pipelines; Surveys; Sustainable development; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Water treatment; Department of interiors; Environmental sustainability; Global warming potential; Hydrologic conditions; Infrastructure systems; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Sustainability assessment; Underground infrastructure; Life cycle,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050919234

When an ensemble of neural networks trains under sMCL, the best performing model receives the majority of parameter updates at the expense of other ensemble members. We refer to this sMCL training issue as Alpha Model Domination (AMD) and empirically demonstrate that AMD does not resolve itself with longer training time.

In order to use external clustering metrics, explicit noise points are usually removed or treated as a single cluster. This modification reduces the relevancy of external metrics as a predictor of performance on unlabeled data, where it is not possible to identify noise points. We propose a modification of standard external metrics to explicitly handle noise points in experimental data. We illustrate the effect of this explicit treatment of noise on clustering evaluation using several examples of common noisy clustering problems as well as a real data set from mass spectrometry. We demonstrate that (external) clustering metrics that explicitly treat noise are more robust than standard (external) clustering metrics in the presence of noise. © 2019 IEEE.",Clustering; External metrics; Noise,Machine learning; Mass spectrometry; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Clustering; Clustering evaluation; Clustering problems; Explicit treatments; External metrics; Gold standards; Noise; Noisy observations; Cluster analysis,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080866192

This poses a problem when an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is tracking multiple ground targets on a road network larger than its field of view. We propose a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) to maintain individual target tracks and to perform probabilistic data association when the targets are constrained to a road network. This is particularly useful when a target leaves then re-enters the UAV's field of view. The RBPF is structured as a particle filter of particle filters. The top level filter handles data association and each of its particles maintains a bank of particle filters to handle target tracking. The tracking particle filters incorporate both positive and negative information when a measurement is received. We then implement a receding horizon controller to improve the filter certainty of multiple target locations. The controller prioritizes searching for targets based on the entropy of each target's estimate. © 2019 American Automatic Control Council.,,,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072289681

Advances in extended dynamic mode decomposition approaches and machine learning methods have enabled data-driven discovery of Koopman operators, for both continuous and discrete-time systems. Since Koopman operators are often infinite-dimensional, they are approximated in practice using finite-dimensional systems. The fidelity and convergence of a given finite-dimensional Koopman approximation is a subject of ongoing research. In this paper we introduce a class of Koopman observable functions that confer an approximate closure property on their corresponding finite-dimensional approximations of the Koopman operator. We derive error bounds for the fidelity of this class of observable functions, as well as identify two key learning parameters which can be used to tune performance. We illustrate our approach on two classical nonlinear system models: the Van Der Pol oscillator and the bistable toggle switch. © 2018 AACC.",,,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052607795

In the U.S., these efforts have resulted in national curricula and increased local expectations. The research on actual implementation often reports on efforts of single schools or districts. This paper provides a high-level description of the practices and challenges of teaching CS in K-12 across an entire state. To better understand how these efforts might increase CS education for all, we surveyed every public school in the state of Utah and analyzed enrollment data for all 19 Utah CS courses. The survey consisted of closed and open-ended questions about each school's current CS practices and personnel. Schools from 39 of 42 public school districts responded (including charter schools) representing 46.3% of the state's high schools, 39.3% of middle/junior high schools, and 28% of elementary schools. Course data indicated that enrollment in CS courses increased considerably in the past five years after the introduction of newer, more fundamental courses. Despite the general enrollment increase, there has been a markedly smaller increase in student enrollment in more advanced CS courses. In this paper, we discuss these and other surprising results, as well as challenges that educators reported in promoting and teaching CS. © 2019 IEEE.",CS education; CS for All; K-12,Curricula; School buildings; Surveys; CS education; Elementary schools; High level description; Local expectations; Open-ended questions; Public school districts; Public schools; Student enrollments; Teaching,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080101881

In order for RFSSW to become a readily implementable welding solution, cycle times must be reduced to an acceptable level, similar to that of well developed, competing spot joining processes. In the present work, an investigation of the RFSSW process is conducted to evaluate factors that have traditionally prevented the process from achieving fast cycle times. Within this investigation, the relationship between cycle time and joint quality is explored, as is the meaning and measurement of cycle time in the RFSSW process. Claims and general sentiment found in prior literature are challenged regarding the potential for high-speed RFSSW joints to be made. The RFSSW weld design-as described by process parameters such as tool feed rate, tool rotational velocity, and plunge depth-is shown through experimentation to affect the loads and torques placed on RFSSW tooling and machines during the welding process. As cycle time is decreased, the load and torque on the toolset are shown to increase. Similarly, as tool rotational velocity is decreased, the load and torque on the toolset is shown to increase. The relationship between machine design limitations and cycle time is also explored. It is demonstrated that welds with cycle times below one second can be produced without compromising material properties, suggesting that high speed RFSSW can be enabled through informed efforts. © 2020 SAE International.

Mathematical models can facilitate process understanding and problem detection, and determine appropriate actions in case of mismatch between model and data. Furthermore, calculations may replace measurements where and when the latter are not available, as normally occurs during connections or when instruments or signal transmissions fail. However, advanced hydraulic models rely on a large set of inputs, such as pipe and wellbore geometry, various tuning parameters and fluid properties. The models are therefore time-consuming and difficult to configure in the field, where third-party experts may be needed at each well, to properly initiate the automation system and adjust it during the drilling process. Although the methods described in this paper are relevant to any critical drilling operation, they are applied to Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) as a widely deployed example of drilling automation. In MPD, hydraulic models predict downhole conditions and determine the requisite choke pressure for automatic adjustment. A new method for automatic configuration of key model parameters simplifies the tedious job of setting up the model and ensures that the automation system remains tuned to the well, even without onsite model tuning expertise. The proposed scheme is based on a simple method for separating inaccuracies due to co-linearity in frictional pressure losses and static mud weight. The search for optimal correction factors is based on a sequence of small oscillations of pump rate that can be applied during drilling without interrupting the operation. A massively parallel computing architecture improves the speed of the calibration algorithm proportional to the number of available CPU cores. A set of hydraulic model instances runs in parallel, allowing for efficient testing of changes in input signals within ranges of uncertainty. A method for selecting a subset of the best models that more accurately represent a given well is proposed. Computer simulations demonstrate how the novel calibration scheme allows automatic tuning of the friction factor and density correction factor, giving accurate prediction of the bottom hole pressure (BHP). The tuning scheme is run with a parallel architecture to demonstrate that correct values of unknown configuration parameters can be automatically determined sufficiently fast for real-time drilling control or as an advisory tool. The deployment of automation systems in drilling is hampered by the need for dedicated expert personnel to maintain systems that could have reduced the personnel needed on the rig. The proposed automated physics-based model tuning contributes to removing this roadblock, aiming at making automation systems a more cost-efficient option for drilling operations.

The data offered by WDP technology has maximum benefit when applied in an automation system or as a real-time advisory tool. Improved control is demonstrated for Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) with the use of high-speed telemetry and physics-based models. Stabilizing and minimizing pressure within an acceptable bound leads to higher and more consistent Rate of Penetration (ROP). MPD control is challenging due to tight pressure windows and the nonlinearity of the choke and pump response on Bottom Hole Pressure (BHP). This work demonstrates a new Hammerstein-Wiener nonlinear model predictive controller for BHP regulation in drilling. Hammerstein-Wiener models employ input and output static nonlinear blocks before and after linear dynamics blocks and thereby simplify the controller design. The control performance is evaluated in scenarios such as drilling, pipe connections, and kick attenuation. A physics-based drilling simulator, WeMod, is used for model identification and control performance evaluation. The control performance of the new nonlinear controller is compared to conventional controllers in various scenarios. Because of the interconnected multivariable and nonlinear nature of the drilling operation, conventional controllers show severe limitations. In a first scenario, the performance of set point tracking during normal drilling operation is compared. By changing the set point of the BHP, the conventional controller manipulates only the choke valve opening while the nonlinear controller moves choke valve opening, mud pump, and back pressure pump simultaneously. In a second scenario, a pipe connection of a typical drillpipe stand is demonstrated. The conventional controller is not able to regulate the BHP by adjusting the choke valve only. Although a linear version of the controller is able to exploit multivariable relationships, absence of the nonlinear relationships results in severe oscillation when the operational range is shifted outside of the training region. The nonlinear controller maintains a BHP within ±1 bar of the requested set point. A third scenario investigates the kick attenuation performance of conventional and nonlinear control algorithms. The nonlinear controller attenuates the kick within well control conditions, without requiring a well shut-in procedure. Recent advances in drilling simulators and the reliability of the WDP data highway have enabled tighter BHP control. This study presents a robust method to control BHP by applying Hammerstein-Wiener models in an efficient model predictive controller. The proposed methods have been validated in the downstream industry, but are applied for the first time to drilling with nonlinear control functionality. The multivariable control adjusts three main manipulated variables in MPD simultaneously.

However, most models and source code have been recreated multiple times, which requires significant effort and energy with little additional benefit or step-wise improvements. The authors propose that it is time to form a coalition of industry and academic leaders to support an open source effort for drilling, to encourage the reuse of continuously improving models and coding efforts. The vision for this guiding coalition is to 1) set up a repository for source code, data, benchmarks, and documentation, 2) encourage good coding practices, 3) review and comment on the models and data submitted, 4) test, use and improve the code, 5) propose and collect anonymized real data, 6) attract talent and support to the effort, and 7) mentor those getting started. Those interested to add their time and talent to the cause may publish their results through peer-reviewed literature. Several online meetings are planned to create this coalition, establish a charter, and layout the guiding principles. Multiple support avenues are proposed to sustain the effort such as: annual user group meetings, create a SPE Technical Section, and initiating a Joint Industry Program (JIP). The Open Porous Media Initiative is just one example of how this could be organized and maintained. As a starting point, this paper reviews existing published drilling models and highlights the similarities and differences for commonly used drillstring hydraulics, dynamics, directional, and bit-rock interaction models. The key requirements for re-usability of the models and code are: 1) The model itself must be available as open source, well documented with the objective and expected outcomes, include commented code, and shared in a publicly available repository which can be updated, 2) A user's guide must include how to run the core software, how to extend software capabilities, i.e., plug in new features or elements, 3) Include a ""theory"" manual to explain the fundamental principles, the base equations, any assumptions, and the known limitations, 4) Data examples and formatting requirements to cover a diversity of drilling operations, and 5) Test cases to benchmark the performance and output of different proposed models. In May 2018 at ""The 4th International Colloquium on Non-linear dynamics and control of deep drilling systems,"" the keynote question was, ""Is it time to start using open source models?"" The answer is ""yes"". Modeling the drilling process is done to help drill a round, ledge free hole, without patterns, with minimum vibration, minimum unplanned dog legs, that reaches all geological targets, in one run per section, and in the least time possible. An open source repository for drilling will speed up the rate of learning and automation efforts to achieve this goal throughout the entire well execution workflow, including planning, BHA design, real-time operations, and post well analysis.

LUVOIR (large, UV-optical-IR telescope) is a potential NASA flagship space-based observatory of the 2020's or 30's. It would utilize the largest mirrors ever flown1. Their reflective coating will almost certainly be aluminum, since such telescopes would profit from truly broad-band mirrors. To achieve reflectance over the broadest band, the top surface of such aluminum mirrors, however, needs to be bare, without the oxide layers that naturally form in air. This will open the 11 to 15 eV band. Since thin aluminum films are largely transparent between 15 and 70 eV an EUV mirror under the aluminum could make EUV bands such as 30.4 nm available for space-based astrophysics without sacrificing mirror IR, visible and UV reflectance. The local space environment for the observatory is sufficiently oxygen-free that the surface should remain bare for decades. We discuss protecting as-deposited aluminum mirrors with robust, oxygenimpenetrable, barrier layers applied in vacuo to the aluminum immediately after deposition and before air contact. The goal is that the barrier could also be cleanly, and relatively easily, removed once the mirror is in space. We propose hydrogen atoms as the means for removing the overcoat, since they can be expected to meet the criteria that the means is gentle enough to not roughen the mirror surface, and does not redeposit material on the mirror or other spacecraft components. We have investigated both organic and inorganic (such as, a-Si) hydrogen-removable films that can be applied to the aluminum immediately after its deposition have been investigated. We also examined the REVAP technique, using Cd and Zn. Agglomeration limited their effectiveness as barrier layers. That and dealing with the reevaporated atoms may limit their utility as barrier materials. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

By structuring the container of a thermal vapor with narrow emission apertures, the velocity distribution can be modified to create a directed beam of atoms.1 These atomic beams can then interact sequentially with a series of optical fields, or interaction zones, and ultimately allow precision control over the internal state of the atom. This is useful for optical frequency standards and precision spectroscopy2, 3 and may also provide the means to build a simple flying qubit platform.4 Furthermore, atomic beams on a chip can be used as a compact, directed source to load magneto-optical traps (MOTs) while minimally increasing the ambient pressure.5 We apply microfabrication techniques to microscopically structure silicon to deterministically control the ow of Rb between connected cavities. We describe a methodology to measure the experimental parameters that govern the flux of atomic vapors in these microfabricated structures with a goal of creating an equivalent electrical circuit model.

However, in non-cooperative situations these unique characteristics are often disturbed. In this study, we examine the effect of six different factors on face detection in an unconstrained imaging environment: Image brightness, image contrast, focus measure, eyewear, gender, and occlusion. The aim of this study is twofold: First, to quantify detection rates of conventional Haar cascade algorithms across these six factors; and second, to propose methods for automatically labeling datasets whose size prohibits manual labeling. First, we manually classify a uniquely challenging dataset comprising 9,688 images of passengers in vehicles acquired from a roadside camera system. Next, we quantify how each of the aforementioned factors affect face detection on this dataset. Of the six factors studied, occlusion had the most significant impact, resulting in a 54% decrease in detection rate between unoccluded and severely occluded faces in our unique dataset. Finally, we provide a methodology for data analytics of large datasets where manual labeling of the whole dataset is not possible. © 2018 SPIE.",face recognition; image processing; machine learning; object detection,Classification (of information); Image processing; Learning systems; Luminance; Object detection; Cascade algorithm; Detection rates; Facial recognition; Image brightness; Image contrasts; Manual labeling; Non cooperative situations; Roadside cameras; Face recognition,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049184118

In this study, we present, for the first time, combined X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ellipsometric (SE) studies of aluminum oxidation as a function of MgF2 over a range of layer thickness (0-6 nm). We also show for the first time, dynamic SE data which, with appropriate modeling, tracks the extent of oxide growth every few seconds over a period of several hours after the evaporated Al + MgF2 bilayer is removed from the deposition chamber, exposing it to the air. For each SE data set, because the optical constants of ultrathin metals films depend strongly on deposition conditions and their thickness, the optical constants for Al, as well as the Al and Al2O3 thicknesses, were fit. SE trends were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. There is a chemical shift in the Al 2s electron emission peak toward higher binding energy as the metal oxidizes to Al+3. The extent of oxide growth can be modeled from the relative area of each peak once they are corrected for the attenuation through MgF2 layer.

By measuring the pump-probe traces while ramping the pump intensity, we observed a clear change in the ultrafast pump-probe dynamics after the phase change. Correlation between the ultrafast dynamics in the femtosecond timescale and the amount of phase change observed in millisecond timescale indicates that accumulation of the excited states in the sample plays an important role in the acceleration of the phase change. The result clearly demonstrates the usefulness of our method, which could be applied to the investigation of multi-timescale dynamics in various irreversible phenomena.

A major cause for this concern arises from the fact that implementation of security protections occur at a local scale, while the important operational security issues stem from a global perspective of the system, e.g., mission assurance. Being able to understand network-wide implications of local cyber protections has the potential to significantly impact the strategies we use to protect modern mission systems. In this work, we present a graph-theoretic perspective on this problem, which is based on a framework for modeling and assessing the integrated cyber-physical dynamics of complex systems. Under the framework, these dynamics (and their relationships) are modeled as a graph and then analyzed using processing techniques from graphtheory. We demonstrate the utility of this framework by conducting insider-attack threat analysis and show how the application of security protections at a local scale impact network-wide security properties from an insider perspective. As a test case, we study the problem of search and rescue (SAR) using unmanned aerial vehicle teams. Unmanned vehicle teams engaged in SAR are prototypical cyber-physical systems, in which local intrusions may cause global disruptions. Here, we describe how the insider modeling framework for cyber-physical dynamics applies to this problem and present results of a network-wide assessment of security properties of the system. We use this assessment to design a security protection for the system in which we use cryptographically secure computation techniques to limit the amount of information sharing required between system components without degrading the correct operation of the system. We show how the application of these techniques on a local scale impacts the security properties of the system on a global scale. © 2018 SPIE.",cybersecurity; graph-theory; insider threat; multiparty computation; simulation; state inference,Antennas; Complex networks; Computation theory; Cryptography; Cyber Physical System; Dynamics; Embedded systems; Graph theory; Cyber security; Insider Threat; Multiparty computation; simulation; state inference; Network security,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049352433

The fundamental problem is that commercial tools and materials, which excel in many other application areas, have not been developed to address the unique needs of microfluidic device fabrication. Consequently, we have created our own stereolithographic 3D printer and materials that are specifically tailored to meet these needs. We review our recent work and show that flow channels as small as 18 _m x 20 _m can be reliably fabricated, as well as compact active elements such as valves and pumps. With these capabilities, we demonstrate highly integrated 3D printed microfluidic devices that measure only a few millimeters on a side, and that integrate separate chip-to-world interfaces through high density interconnects (up to 88 interconnects per square mm) that are directly 3D printed as part of a device chip. These advances open the door to 3D printing as a replacement for expensive cleanroom fabrication processes, with the additional advantage of fast (30 minute), parallel fabrication of many devices in a single print run due to their small size. © 2019 SPIE.",3D printing; Lab on a chip; Microfluidics; Stereolithography,Fabrication; Fluidic devices; Integrated circuit interconnects; Lab-on-a-chip; Microfluidics; Stereolithography; 3-D printing; Active elements; Application area; Commercial tools; Fabrication process; High density interconnects; Lab-on-a-chip devices; Micro-fluidic devices; 3D printers,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068055372

The resulting images rely on visual persistence as laser light scatters from the particle, which is rapidly swept through the 3-D pattern. Control can be maintained while moving the particle with air speeds up to 2 m/s. A desire to greatly increase the sweep speed motivates a re-examination of the fundamentals of photophoresis-based laser-particle traps. Most explanations offered are qualitative, with differing opinions as to whether, for example, asymmetric heating or asymmetric thermal accommodation is primarily at work. Which particles become trapped in the beam is typically based on self-selection, as a variety of particles with possible differing shapes and sizes are offered to the laser focus for capture. Characteristics that make some particles preferred over others are especially relevant. There is broad consensus that structure in the laser focus greatly aids in stable trapping. Nevertheless, it is still possible for even a relatively smooth TEM00 beam to capture and hold particles. Moreover, even in a structured focus (i.e. with aberrations and local intensity minima and maxima), questions remain as to exactly how a particle becomes stably trapped in certain beam locations. A zoomed-in look at trapped particles reveals oscillations or orbits with excursions over tens of microns and accelerations up to 10 gs. We trapped particles in zero-gravity as well as 2-g environments with no noticeable difference in stability. © 2018 SPIE.",Optical trapping; Photophoresis; Volumetric display,Laser beams; Micromanipulators; Asymmetric heating; Centimeter-scale; Laser particles; Microscopic particle; Opticaltrapping; Photophoresis; Thermal accommodation; Trapped particle; Three dimensional displays,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055502611

For example, intent can mean to find a path that balances between ""Go quickly"" and ""Go stealthily"". Given human expectations about how a path balances such tradeoffs, the path should match the human's intent throughout the entire execution of the path even if the environment changes. If the path drifts from the human's intent because the environment changes, then a new robotic-path needs to be planned - referred to as path-replanning. We discuss here three system-initiated triggers (prompts) for path-replanning. The objective is to create an interactive replanning system that yields paths that consistently match human intent. The triggers are to replan (a) at regular time intervals, (b) when the current robotic path deviates from the user intent, and (c) when a better path can be obtained from a different homotopy class. Further, we consider one user-generated replanning trigger that allows the user to stop the robot anytime to put the robot onto a new route. These four trigger variants seek to answer two fundamental critical questions: When is a re-planned path acceptable to a human? and How should a planner involve a human in replanning? © 2018 SPIE.",BDI; Commitment; Graphical user interfaces; Human-robot collaboration; Human-robot interaction; Human-robot teams; Intent; Intention; Multi-objective path planing; Plans; Reasoning; Replanning; Tradeoffs,C (programming language); Economic and social effects; Graphical user interfaces; Human computer interaction; Motion planning; Robotics; Commitment; Human-robot collaboration; Human-robot-team; Intent; Intention; Path planing; Plans; Re-planning; Reasoning; Tradeoffs; Human robot interaction,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050802041

As the diffusion tensor model has limitations in brain regions with crossing fibers, novel diffusion MRI reconstruction models may offer more accurate measures of tissue properties, and a better understanding of the brain abnormalities in specific diseases. Here we studied a large sample of 249 participants with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), a neurogenetic condition associated with high rates of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders, and 224 age-matched healthy controls (HC) (age range: 8-35 years). Participants were scanned with dMRI at eight centers worldwide. Using a meta-analytic approach, we assessed the profile of group differences in four diffusion anisotropy measures to better understand the patterns of WM microstructural abnormalities and evaluate their consistency across alternative measures. When assessed in atlas-defined regions of interest, we found statistically significant differences for all anisotropy measures, all showing a widespread but not always coinciding pattern of effects. The tensor distribution function fractional anisotropy (TDF-FA) showed largest effect sizes all in the same direction (greater anisotropy in 22q11DS than HC). Fractional anisotropy based on the tensor model (FA) showed the second largest effect sizes after TDF-FA; some regions showed higher mean values in 22q11DS, but others lower. Generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) showed the opposite pattern to TDF-FA with most regions showing lower anisotropy in 22q11DS versus HC. Anisotropic power maps (AP) showed the lowest effect sizes also with a mixed pattern of effects across regions. These results were also consistent across skeleton projection methods, with few differences when projecting anisotropy values from voxels sampled on the FA map or projecting values from voxels sampled from each anisotropy map. This study highlights that different mathematical definitions of anisotropy may lead to different profiles of group differences, even in large, well-powered population studies. Further studies of biophysical models derived from multi-shell dMRI and histological validations may help to understand the sources of these differences. 22q11DS is a promising model to study differences among novel anisotropy/dMRI measures, as group differences are relatively large and there exist animal models suitable for histological validation. © SPIE.

Previously a detailed model was developed for soot formation depicting the soot particle size distribution using the method of moments with interpolative closure. This model is both accurate and complex. Computational expense of this model may be beyond many large-scale simulations. As a result, a simplified version of this detailed model has been developed. This simplified model makes two easy assumptions to drastically reduce the complexity of modeling soot formation. First assumption is that soot particles and soot precursors within a computational domain are assumed to be mono-dispersed, meaning all particles are the same size. This reduces the number of resolved terms to model both soot precursors and soot particles to three resolved terms rather than the 10+ terms required by the previously developed model. Second assumption is that all particles are spherical. While the simplified model is computationally less expensive, these two assumptions come with a cost in accuracy. Presented is both the development of this simplified model along with comparative simulations where the complex and simple models are ran. From these simulations, researchers and developers can justify which model may be used in their respective systems. © 2018 Western States Section/Combustion Institute.

Using a grounded theory methodology, we analyzed the interview data and found that participants chose their security posture based on the immense value the Internet provides and their belief that no combination of technology could make them perfectly safe. Within this context, users have a four-stage process for determining which security measures to adopt: learning, evaluation of risks, estimation of impact, and weighing trade-offs to various coping strategies. Our results also revealed that a majority of participants understand the basic principles of symmetric encryption. We found that participants' misconceptions related to browser-based TLS indicators lead to insecure behavior, and it is the permanence of encrypted email that causes participants to doubt that it is secure.

Unfortunately, evidence to date suggests users are unable to do this. Accordingly, we study in detail how well users can locate and complete the authentication ceremony when they are aware of the need for authentication. We execute a two-phase study involving 36 pairs of participants, using three popular messaging applications with support for secure messaging functionality: WhatsApp, Viber, and Facebook Messenger. The first phase included instruction about potential threats, while the second phase also included instructions about the importance of the authentication ceremony. We find that, across the three apps, the average success rates of finding and completing the authentication ceremony increases from 14% to 79% from the first to second phase, with second-phase success rates as high as 96% for Viber. However, the time required to find and complete the ceremony is undesirably long from a usability standpoint, and our data is inconclusive on whether users make the connection between this ceremony and the security guarantees it brings. We discuss in detail the success rates, task timings, and user feedback for each application, as well as common mistakes and user grievances.

This is especially true for encryption because the cost of mistakes can be disastrous. Nevertheless, until now, mental models of encryption have only been tangentially explored as part of more broadly focused studies. In this work, we present the first directed effort at exploring user perceptions of encryption: both mental models of what encryption is and how it works as well as views on its role in everyday life. We performed 19 semi-structured phone interviews with participants across the United States, using both standard interview techniques and a diagramming exercise where participants visually demonstrated their perception of the encryption process. We identified four mental models of encryption which, though varying in detail and complexity, ultimately reduce to a functional abstraction of restrictive access control and naturally coincide with a model of symmetric encryption. Additionally, we find the impersonal use of encryption to be an important part of participants' models of security, with a widespread belief that encryption is frequently employed by service providers to encrypt data at rest. In contrast, the personal use of encryption is viewed as reserved for illicit or immoral activity, or for the paranoid. © 2018 by The USENIX Association All Rights Reserved.",,Access control; Cognitive systems; Driving forces; Functional abstractions; Mental model; Personal use; Semi-structured; Service provider; Symmetric encryption; User perceptions; Cryptography,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067281351

Although users may fail to heed a security warning for a variety of reasons, a major contributor is habituation, which is decreased response to repeated stimulation. However, the scope of this problem may actually be much broader than previously thought because of the neurobiological phenomenon of generalization. Whereas habituation describes a diminished response with repetitions of the same stimulus, generalization occurs when habituation to one stimulus carries over to other novel stimuli that are similar in appearance. Generalization has important implications for the domains of usable security and human-computer interaction. Because a basic principle of user interface design is visual consistency, generalization suggests that through exposure to frequent non-security-related notifications (e.g., dialogs, alerts, confirmations, etc.) that share a similar look and feel, users may become deeply habituated to critical security warnings that they have never seen before. Further, with the increasing number of notifications in our lives across a range of mobile, Internet of Things, and computing devices, the accumulated effect of generalization may be substantial. However, this problem has not been empirically examined before. This paper contributes by measuring the impacts of generalization in terms of (1) diminished attention via mouse cursor tracking and (2) users' ability to behaviorally adhere to security warnings. Through an online experiment, we find that: ¥ Habituation to a frequent non-security-related notification does carry over to a one-time security warning. ¥ Generalization of habituation is manifest both in (1) decreased attention to warnings and (2) lower warning adherence behavior. ¥ The carry-over effect, most importantly, is due to generalization, and not fatigue. ¥ The degree that generalization occurs depends on the similarity in look and feel between a notification and warning. These findings open new avenues of research and provide guidance to software developers for creating warnings that are more resistant to the effects of generalization of habituation, thereby improving users' security warning adherence. © is held by the author/owner.",,Human computer interaction; Security of data; User interfaces; Basic principles; Carry-over effects; Computing devices; On-line experiments; Provide guidances; Software developer; User interface designs; Visual consistency; Mammals,Conference,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076108750

There is strong support for notification and consent when a system is intercepting their encrypted traffic, although this support varies depending on the situation. A significant concern about malicious uses of TLS inspection is identity theft, and many would react negatively and some would change their behavior if they discovered inspection occurring without their knowledge.

Predictive CFD simulations are valuable tools in evaluating and deploying oxy-fuel and other carbon capture technologies either as retrofit technologies or for new construction. However, accurate predictive simulations require physically realistic submodels with low computational requirements. In particular, comprehensive char oxidation and gasification models have been developed that describe multiple reaction and diffusion processes. This work extends a comprehensive char conversion code (CCK), which treats surface oxidation and gasification reactions as well as the processes such as film diffusion, pore diffusion, ash encapsulation, and annealing. In this work several submodels in the CCK code were updated with more realistic physics or otherwise extended to function in oxycoal conditions. Improved submodels include the annealing model, the swelling model, the mode of burning parameter, and the kinetic model, as well as the addition of the Chemical Percolation Devolatilization (CPD) model.

The focus of this paper is to improve the accuracy of devolatilization submodels, to be used in conjunction with other particle physics models. Many large simulations today rely on inaccurate assumptions about particle compositions, including that the volatiles that are released during pyrolysis are of the same elemental composition as the char particle. Another common assumption is that the char particle can be approximated by pure carbon. These assumptions will lead to inaccuracies in the overall simulation. There are many factors that influence pyrolysis product composition, including parent coal composition, pyrolysis conditions (including particle temperature history and heating rate), and others.

Fire spread in live chamise and big sagebrush shrubs was measured in an open-roofed wind tunnel, which was used as the basis to develop the current model.

These profiles are modulated using recycled flue gas that acts as the diluent normally served by nitrogen during air firing. The large amounts of recycled flue gas (RFG) required leads to efficiency losses, making the economics of this process less attractive. Oxy-coal combustion economics can be improved in advanced oxy-combustion processes that may involve zero or minimal RFG and possibly high combustion pressures. This paper addresses effects of high combustion temperatures resulting from minimal RFG, on ash aerosol formation and ash deposition mechanisms. Issues related to ash deposition play important roles in being able to predict overall boiler performance. Effects of high pressure will be reported in future work. A 100kW downfired laboratory combustor is used to compare ash aerosol formation and deposition under two conditions: 1) using 27% O2 in the inlet oxidant gas (denoted as OXY27), representing first generation oxy-combustion (heat transfer conditions similar to air firing for retrofit); 2) with 70% O2 in the inlet oxidant gas (denoted as OXY70), representing advanced oxy-combustion where the RFG is used only to transport the coal, not to modulate flame temperatures. The ash aerosol particle size distributions and its size segregated composition were determined using on-line electric mobility/light scattering analyzers and low pressure impactors, respectively. Their relationship to ash deposition rates as determined using a specially designed deposition probe was explored. The data show that, compared to the retrofit conditions of OXY27, the advanced oxy-coal combustion in OXY70 produce much higher concentrations of submicron particles due to increased mineral vaporization at the high flame temperature and the decreased flue gas flow rate. This appeared to lead to significant increases in deposition rates. Changes in the supermicron particle concentration were in line with those expected by the lower flue gas alone, suggesting that mineral fragmentation is not greatly affected by temperature. Deposition rates of both inside and outside deposits, as defined in earlier work, are interpreted in the light of recently developed hypotheses that point to the importance of the submicron particle ash concentration. © 2017 Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute.

If different turbine hub heights and rotor diameters are included in the same wind farm, the wake interference in the farm will be reduced, resulting in a lower cost of energy (COE) than a farm with identical turbines. In this paper, we present a method to model wind farm COE in farms with hub heights and rotor diameters that vary across the wind farm. We also demonstrate how to optimize these wind farms to minimize COE. The results show that COE can be greatly reduced in wind farms with non-homogeneous turbines, especially when the turbines are spaced close together. For a unidirectional wind rose, including different turbine design in the wind farm has a similar decrease in COE to spreading the wind turbines farther apart. When the rotor diameter and hub height of the wind turbines in a farm are optimized uniformly, a COE decrease of 4% to 13% (depending on the grid spacing and wind shear exponent) is achieved compared to the baseline. When the rotor diameter and turbine heights are optimized non-uniformly, with two different diameters and heights throughout the farm, there is a COE decrease of 22% to 41% compared to the baseline. For a more spread wind rose with a dominant probability from the west, there is a COE decrease between 3% and 10% for uniformly optimized rotor diameter and height compared to the baseline. With two optimized rotor diameters and heights through the farm, a COE decrease of 3% to 19% is achieved. For a similar wind rose shifted such that the dominant wind direction is from the northwest, a COE decrease between 3% and 10% results from uniformly optimized wind turbines compared to the baseline.

Current wind farms are generally built with turbines that are all the same height, but if wind farms included turbines with different tower heights, the cost of energy may be reduced. We used gradient-based optimization to demonstrate a method to optimize wind farms with varied hub heights. Our study includes a modified version of the FLORIS wake model that accommodates three-dimensional wakes integrated with a tower structural model. Our purpose was to design a process to minimize the cost of energy of a wind farm through layout optimization and varying turbine hub heights. Results indicate that when a farm is optimized for layout and height with two separate height groups, COE can be lowered by as much as 5-9%, compared to a similar layout and height optimization where all the towers are the same. The COE has the best improvement in farms with high turbine density and low wind shear exponent. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

According to previous studies, there are two possible factors: the Mach waves, which are radiated from the free-jet region and reflected by the plate, and the acoustic waves generated in the impingement region. To distinguish the effects of these factors, this study compares the following three results: the overall sound pressure level distribution, images extracted from the schlieren visualization movies using acoustic-triggered conditional sampling, and tracing lines of the acoustic intensity vectors of the Mach waves. The results reveal that the nozzleÐplate distance affects the fraction of the Mach waves that are generated in the free-jet region and reflected by the plate, resulting in a higher overall sound pressure level in the upstream direction for larger nozzleÐplate distances. It is concluded that the location of the plate relative to the source region of the Mach waves significantly affects the acoustic phenomena, owing to the variation in the nozzleÐplate distances.

However, recent modifications to large eddy-simulation (LES) methods allow for simulations of jets operating at a high-temperature ratio in a similar regime as military aircraft operating at afterburner. This work applies coherence analyses that have been previously used to study the jet noise field produced by military aircraft to the LES of a highly heated laboratory-scale jet. The coherence of the complex pressures along a near-field line approximately parallel to the shear layer as well as along the nozzle lip line shows evidence of distinct noise production mechanisms that transfer information differently from the flow to the field. A phenomenological comparison between the LES and measurements of an afterburning F-35 aircraft is then made. Although the LES is not run at the exact same conditions as the aircraft and does not reproduce all of the phenomena present in the aircraftÕs jet noise field, differences between noise production mechanisms observed in the LES may describe some of the spatiospectral lobe phenomena observed in the measurements of the F-35. © 2020 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Several methods exist for stowing, deploying, and stiffening large space arrays. Often these functions are performed by separate systems. This work presents a novel array system that integrates these functions into one system, without the need for external deployment or stiffening structures. The integration comes from the combination of the kinematics of origami-based folding approaches, stored strain energy of compliant hinges, and tension cables. Additionally, due to the origami-based folding approach used, tunable deployed shapes and retraction are possible using reeled cables. The result is a new array architecture that is self-deployable, self-stiffening, and retractable (SDSR) and is described in this work. To understand the behavior of such systems, this work presents the modeling and testing of an SDSR array using an origami flasher pattern and discusses the results for the performance considerations of deployment motion, deployment stiffness, and dynamics. © 2020 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Men with ED generally complain failure to attain or maintain an adequate erection during sexual activity. The prevalence of ED is strongly correlated with age, affecting about 40% of men at age 40 and nearly 70% at age 70. A variety of chronic diseases, including diabetes, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, depression, chronic renal failure, obstructive sleep apnea, prostate disease, gout, and sleep disorder, were reported to be associated with ED. In this study, data retrieved from a subset of the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan were used for designing the clinical decision support system (CDSS) for predicting ED incidences in men. The positive cases were male patients aged 20-65 who were diagnosed with ED between January 2000 and December 2010 confirmed by at least three outpatient visits or at least one inpatient visit, while the negative cases were randomly selected from the database without a history of ED and were frequency (1:1), age, and index year matched with the ED patients. Data of a total of 2832 ED patients and 2832 non-ED patients, each consisting of 41 features including index age, 10 comorbidities, and 30 other comorbidity-related variables, were retrieved for designing the predictive models. Integrated genetic algorithm and support vector machine was adopted to design the CDSSs with two experiments of independent training and testing (ITT) conducted to verify their effectiveness. In the 1st ITT experiment, data extracted from January 2000 till December 2005 (61.51%, 1742 positive cases and 1742 negative cases) were used for training and validating and the data retrieved from January 2006 till December 2010 were used for testing (38.49%), whereas in the 2nd ITT experiment, data in the training set (77.78%) were extracted from January 2000 till Deceber 2007 and those in the testing set (22.22%) were retrieved afterward. Tenfold cross validation and three different objective functions were adopted for obtaining the optimal models with best predictive performance in the training phase. The testing results show that the CDSSs achieved a predictive performance with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, g-mean, and area under ROC curve of 74.72%-76.65%, 72.33%-83.76%, 69.54%-77.10%, 0.7468-0.7632, and 0.766-0.817, respectively.

High fidelity, wavelength dependent multi-spot patterns from MMI waveguides are useful for sensitive and simultaneous identification of multiple targets in multiplexed fluorescence optofluidic biosensors. Through experiments and simulation, this paper explores design parameters for an MMI rib anti-resonant reflecting optical waveguide in order to produce high fidelity spot patterns at the liquid core biomarker excitation region. Width and etch depth of the single excitation rib waveguide used to excite the MMI waveguide are especially critical because they determine the size of the input optical mode which is imaged at the MMI waveguide's output. To increase optical throughput into the MMI waveguide when light is coupled in from an optical fiber, tapers in the waveguide width can be used for better mode matching. © 2012 IEEE.",Dielectric waveguides; fluorescence; fluorescence spectroscopy; integrated optics; multimode waveguides; multiplexing; rib waveguides,Dielectric waveguides; Emission spectroscopy; Fluorescence; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Integrated optics; Multiplexing; Optical fibers; Antiresonant reflecting optical waveguides; Excitation pattern; Multi-mode interference; Multi-mode waveguides; Optical throughput; Optofluidic biosensor; Rib waveguides; Simultaneous identification; Waveguides,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043762684

State-of-the-art algorithms for calculating the relative pose between two images use matching features to estimate the essential matrix. The essential matrix is then decomposed into the relative rotation and normalized translation between frames. To be robust to noise and feature match outliers, these methods generate a large number of essential matrix hypotheses from randomly selected minimal subsets of feature pairs, and then score these hypotheses on all feature pairs. Alternatively, the algorithm introduced in this paper calculates relative pose hypotheses by directly optimizing the rotation and normalized translation between frames, rather than calculating the essential matrix and then performing the decomposition. The resulting algorithm improves computation time by an order of magnitude. If an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is available, it is used to seed the optimizer, and in addition, we reuse the best hypothesis at each iteration to seed the optimizer thereby reducing the number of relative pose hypotheses that must be generated and scored.

State-of-the-art algorithms for calculating the relative pose between two images use matching features to estimate the essential matrix. The essential matrix is then decomposed into the relative rotation and normalized translation between frames. To be robust to noise and feature match outliers, these methods generate a large number of essential matrix hypotheses from randomly selected minimal subsets of feature pairs, and then score these hypotheses on all feature pairs. Alternatively, the algorithm introduced in this paper calculates relative pose hypotheses by directly optimizing the rotation and normalized translation between frames, rather than calculating the essential matrix and then performing the decomposition. The resulting algorithm improves computation time by an order of magnitude. If an inertial measurement unit (IMU) is available, it is used to seed the optimizer, and in addition, we reuse the best hypothesis at each iteration to seed the optimizer thereby reducing the number of relative pose hypotheses that must be generated and scored. These advantages greatly speed up performance and enable the algorithm to run in real-time on low cost embedded hardware.

The voltage gain of this stage can be maximised by operating the MOS devices in the moderate inversion region rather than the strong inversion region. In so doing, the voltage gains of the differential stage can reach values of over 120ÊdB and the power dissipation is minimised due to the low currents required.

A review of previous, related research is provided. A description of the proposed method of team organization is given, along with methods of data collection and a comparison of the proposed method to common methods. How students were divided into teams and each team's method of organizing sub-teams are described. Use of online surveys, tests, statistical methods, and other data gathering and analysis methods are explained. Statistical analysis of survey results and qualitative results of interviews and observations suggest that a profile-based method for organizing teams results in significantly higher team satisfaction. Some methods for measuring and/or predicting individual attributes related to teamwork, such as the significance of participation in team sports, were validated. No correlation was found between which university a student attended and a student's level of satisfaction with his or her team.

While a large body of work exists on droplet impingement on hydrophilic and superhydrophilic surfaces, impingement on the latter two has been largely neglected and the present results show that dynamics are dramatically different. Experiments ranging in surface temperature from 125¡C to 415¡C and Weber numbers from 10 to 225 were performed and analyzed using high-speed imaging. Some of the most striking differences are as follows. While atomization is always present for impingement on the hydrophilic and superhydrophilic surfaces at temperatures below the Leidenfrost point, atomization is absent at low Weber numbers and at low excess surface temperatures on the hydrophobic surface. At high surface temperatures, the attraction of vapor bubbles on the hydrophobic surface allows a vapor blanket to form more readily thus leading to Leidenfrost behavior at a much lower temperature than classically observed on a hydrophilic surface. One of the most interesting phenomenon that will be discussed includes what will be described as a Òpseudo-LeidenfrostÓ state for impingement on the superhydrophobic surface. Because water can be suspended at the peaks of the roughness on a superhydrophobic interface, vapor escapes from underneath the droplet thus mimicking Leidenfrost behavior for all excess temperatures. This results in minimal atomization for superhydrophobic impingement over the entire regime explored. Finally, maximum spread diameters for Leidenfrost impingement are tabulated as a function of the Weber number for all surfaces and are shown to be larger on the smooth surfaces than on the textured ones indicating that droplet spreading at the Leidenfrost point is not independent of surface type as previously supposed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Boiling; Droplet impingement; Superhydrophobic,Big data;Atmospheric temperature; Atomization; Boiling liquids; Drops; Hydrodynamics; Hydrophilicity; Phase interfaces; Surface properties; Wetting; Droplet impingement; Hydrophilic surfaces; Hydrophobic surfaces; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Superhydrophilic surface; Superhydrophobic; Surface temperatures; Water droplet impingement; Hydrophobicity,Journal,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009936506

Circular micropillars 4 _m in height with varying center-to-center distances (pitch) of 8 _m, 12 _m and 16 _m, are used to create the superhydrophobic surfaces. The range of surface temperatures explored is 110¡C&lt;Ts&lt;337¡C. An image processing algorithm was developed to quantify the temporal behavior of thermally induced atomization captured via high-speed photography. Results show thermally induced atomization is initially absent (&lt;1 ms following impact) on all surfaces. The amount of ejected droplets later during droplet spreading is determined as a function of surface structuring and temperature. Atomization ceases when the surface has cooled sufficiently (2.5Ð4 ms depending on the surface). The maximum amount of atomization for a given scenario is highly dependent on surface temperature and surface microstructure characteristics. At low surface temperatures, atomization increases with increasing surface temperature; however at high surface temperatures atomization decreases with increasing surface temperature. This rise and fall behavior is tantamount to the classical relationship between heat flux and surface temperature for pool boiling. Both droplet impingement and pool boiling depend on vapor bubble formation dynamics and the stability of the so-called Leidenfrost vapor film, which is impacted by surface wettability. Results also show that small surface pitch causes a high atomization intensity, indicating that not all superhydrophobic surfaces sustain Leidenfrost-like behavior at all excess temperatures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,Big data;Atmospheric temperature; Atomization; Boiling liquids; Drops; Hydrodynamics; Hydrophilicity; Phase interfaces; Surface properties; Wetting; Droplet impingement; Hydrophilic surfaces; Hydrophobic surfaces; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Superhydrophilic surface; Superhydrophobic; Surface temperatures; Water droplet impingement; Hydrophobicity,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048962910

All surfaces tested were submerged in a 20 mm deep pool of water and heated from below to maintain a constant surface temperature, while the side walls of the pool were insulated, and the top was covered. Three thermocouples positioned in the pool obtain the average pool temperature. A heat flux sensor is placed directly beneath the surface to measure the heat flux supplied to the pool. Free convection heat transfer coefficients are obtained for the sub-boiling temperature range of 40Ð90 ¡C. Six surface types are studied: smooth hydrophilic, smooth hydrophobic, superhydrophobic with rib/cavity structures, superhydrophobic with rib/cavity structures and additional sparsely spaced ribs to close off the cavities, circular posts, and circular holes. It is found that structured superhydrophobic surfaces provide cavities for nucleation to occur. More dissolved air effervesces from the water as the surface temperature increases due to an increased level of supersaturation and convection. The nucleation leads to large air bubble formations that reduce the overall convection coefficient when compared to the smooth surfaces. For the rib/cavity structured surfaces, the bubbles form in an anisotropic manner and are aligned with the surface structure. More bubbles are observed on the superhydrophobic surfaces where the cavities are bounded. Since water's ability to dissolve air is dependent on temperature, heat and mass transfer cannot be treated independently on any of the superhydrophobic surfaces studied here. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Natural convection; Nucleation; Superhydrophobic,Big data;Atmospheric temperature; Atomization; Boiling liquids; Drops; Hydrodynamics; Hydrophilicity; Phase interfaces; Surface properties; Wetting; Droplet impingement; Hydrophilic surfaces; Hydrophobic surfaces; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Superhydrophilic surface; Superhydrophobic; Surface temperatures; Water droplet impingement; Hydrophobicity,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054812469

When water that is saturated with air is used as the working liquid, the non-wetted cavities on the superhydrophobic surfaces act as nucleation sites and allow air to effervesce out of the water and onto the surface when heated. Previous works in the literature have only considered the opposite case where the water is undersaturated and absorbs air out the cavities for a microchannel setting. The microchannel considered in this work consists of a rib/cavity structured superhydrophobic surface and a glass surface separated by spacers. The microchannel is 60 mm long by 14 mm wide and two channel heights of nominally 183 _m and 366 _m are explored. The superhydrophobic side is in contact with a heated aluminum block and a camera is used to visualize the flow through the glass side. Thermocouples are embedded in the aluminum to record the temperature profile along the length of the channel. Temperatures are maintained below the boiling temperature of the working liquid. The friction factor-Reynolds product (fRe) is obtained via pressure drop and volumetric flow-rate measurements. Five surface types/configurations are investigated: smooth hydrophilic, smooth hydrophobic, superhydrophobic with ribs perpendicular to the flow, superhydrophobic with ribs parallel to the flow, and superhydrophobic with ribs parallel to the flow with several breaker ridges perpendicular to the flow. The surface type/configuration has a significant impact on the mass transport dynamics. For surfaces with closed cell micro-structures, large bubbles eventually form and adversely affect fRe and lead to higher temperatures along the channel. When degassed water is used, no bubble nucleation is observed and the air initially trapped in the superhydrophobic cavities is quickly absorbed by the water. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Convection; Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Microchannel; Nucleation; Superhydrophobic,Indexing; Aluminum; Aspect ratio; Flow rate; Glass; Heat convection; Heat transfer; Laminar flow; Mass transfer; Microchannels; Nucleation; Surface properties; Thermocouples; Boiling temperature; Bubble nucleation; High aspect ratio; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Superhydrophobic; Temperature profiles; Transport dynamics; Volumetric flow rate; Hydrophobicity,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039982303

A discrete ordinates method is used to solve the radiative heat transfer equation with radiative properties calculated using a weighted-sum-of-grey-gases (WSGG) model for gases and Mie and Rayleigh theory for particles including fuel, ash and soot. Measurement data gathered from a pilot-scale test furnace, comprising temperature, gas composition and particle concentration, is used in combination with temperature data and operation parameters gathered from a conventional rotary kiln to model a full-scale rotary kiln with a present bed material. The modelled cases have a thermal input of about 37 MWth and in addition to radiative heat transfer, conductive heat transfer within, as well as between, the bed and wall material are included in the model along with convective heat transfer from the gas and heat release from exothermic reactions in the bed. The model also considers the rotational wall and includes a simplified mixing model of the bed material as well as heat losses from the outside wall of the rotary kiln due to radiation and convection.

Different from impingement on hydrophilic substrates, the droplets rebound from the surface after the spreading and retraction stages. Experiments are performed using simultaneous high speed video and infrared (IR) imaging to capture droplet dynamics and temperature variation during the transient event. Thermal images allow estimation of bulk droplet temperature change during contact such that the cooling effectiveness for an individual droplet can be estimated. A similarity solution is utilized to yield a model for the transient heat flux at the droplet-wall interface, where convection inside the droplet is accounted for. The experimental and theoretical results for the cooling effectiveness show good agreement.

The extent of the cavity effect is quantified using apparent absorptivity and apparent emissivity. Analysis of complicated thermal systems is simplified through application of apparent radiative properties to cavity geometries. The apparent radiative properties of a specularly-reflecting, gray, isothermal V-groove have been derived analytically, but these results have not been validated experimentally or numerically. Additionally, the model for apparent absorptivity of an infinite V-groove subjected to partial illumination in the presence of collimated irradiation is not available. In this work, the following existing models for a specularly-reflecting V-groove are collected into a single source: (1) the apparent absorptivity of a diffusely irradiated V-groove, (2) the apparent emissivity of an isothermal V-groove and (3) the apparent absorptivity of a V-groove subject to collimated irradiation with full-illumination. Further, a new analytical model is developed to predict the apparent absorptivity of an infinite V-groove subject to collimated irradiation with partial-illumination. A custom, Monte Carlo ray tracing solver is used to predict the apparent radiative properties for all cases as a means of numerical verification by comparing the ray tracing data with the results from the new model in this work and the previously existing models. For diffuse irradiation, the analytical model and ray tracing data show excellent agreement with an average discrepancy of 4.4 _ 10_4, verifying the diffuse-irradiation analytical model. Similar agreement is found for collimated irradiation, where the full and partial illumination models indicate average discrepancies of 4.9 _ 10_4 and 4.6 _ 10_4 when compared with ray tracing data. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Angular surfaces; Cavity effect; Specular reflection; V-groove; Variable emissivity surface,Indexing; Aluminum; Aspect ratio; Flow rate; Glass; Heat convection; Heat transfer; Laminar flow; Mass transfer; Microchannels; Nucleation; Surface properties; Thermocouples; Boiling temperature; Bubble nucleation; High aspect ratio; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Superhydrophobic; Temperature profiles; Transport dynamics; Volumetric flow rate; Hydrophobicity,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044440753

Static radiative heat exchangers are often simple and reliable systems but typically cannot be adapted to environmental changes. Adaptable radiative heat exchangers can be adjusted in response to variations in the thermal environment or operating conditions and have the potential for increased efficiency and reduced cost. Dynamic control of a radiative heat exchanger is possible through geometric manipulation of a segmented, self-irradiating fin, consisting of rigid panels that are linked by thermal hinges in an accordion arrangement. In this paper, a numerical model is described to predict the temperature profile and efficiency of a radiative heat exchanger, accounting for conduction and self-irradiation. Governing equations are cast in terms of the conduction-radiation interaction parameter, surface emissivity, actuation angle, and the thermal conductance of the hinges linking the panels. Results indicate that a turn-down ratio (largest possible heat rate divided by smallest possible heat rate) of greater than three is possible for realistic panel geometries and materials. Self-irradiation decreases the turn-down ratio, and there is evidence that an optimal number of rigid panels exists for any combination of panel geometry and device temperature. The maximum efficiency occurs when the plates are in the collapsed position, but the heat rate is at a minimum in this configuration. Finally, the properties and geometry of the plates are shown to have a more significant effect on the turn-down ratio than the properties of the thermal hinges. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,Data processing; Efficiency; Geometry; Heat transfer; Hinges; Irradiation; Temperature control; Conduction radiations; Design and optimization; Environmental change; Geometric manipulation; Temperature profiles; Thermal conductance; Thermal control systems; Thermal environment; Heat exchangers,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070066445

Current methods to accomplish this have prohibitively long lead times due to extensive sample preparation. This work details the use of quantum dots thermomarkers to measure the surface temperature of thin fibers in a non-contact manner and determine the fibersÕ thermal diffusivity. Neural networks are trained on extracting the temperature of a sample from fluorescence spectra in calibrated, steady-state conditions, based on different spectral features such as peak intensity and peak wavelength. The trained neural networks are then used to reconstruct the evolution of the surface temperature in transient heating experiments. In order to determine the thermal properties of a thin fiber, modulated laser heating is applied and an FFT-based method is used to extract the phase and amplitude response of the temperature field at the modulation frequency. The spatiotemporal dependence of the fluorescence signal, obtained by scanning the distance between the excitation and detection laser spots and varying the frequency response due to an axial scan and a frequency scan, is then curve-fit to the resulting decay curves by a photothermal model in order to determine the thermal diffusivity of the fiber. The measured thermal diffusivity (3.3Ê±Ê0.8Ê_Ê10_7Êm2Ês_1) of a synthetic spider silk fiber by the current method has similar properties to other synthetic silk fibers, and demonstrates the ability of the current method to more rapidly measure thermophysical properties of thin fibers. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",FFT; Neural networks; Photothermal; Quantum dots; Thermal diffusivity; Thermometry,Data processing; Efficiency; Geometry; Heat transfer; Hinges; Irradiation; Temperature control; Conduction radiations; Design and optimization; Environmental change; Geometric manipulation; Temperature profiles; Thermal conductance; Thermal control systems; Thermal environment; Heat exchangers,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019570356

An integral analysis of the transport equations resulting in a system of ordinary differential equations was solved numerically. Impingement on superhydrophobic surfaces greatly reduces the heat transfer that occurs relative to a smooth surface due to gas trapped in cavities on the surface. This results in an apparent slip velocity and temperature jump at the surface. Local and average Nusselt numbers are presented as a function of radial position (0 to 45 jet radii), jet Reynolds number (3_103 to 1.5_104), liquid Prandtl number (2 to 11), normalized slip length (0 to 0.2), and normalized temperature jump length (0 to 0.2). All results are compared to classical (no-slip, no temperature jump) behavior on a smooth surface. Although local Nusselt numbers for the isoflux scenario are greater than the corresponding isothermal case, the difference in Nusselt number between these two heating conditions becomes negligible as the temperature jump length increases to quantities realizable on superhydrophobic surfaces.

The surface microstructures were geometrically defined by cavity fraction (the ratio of projected cavity area to surface area), pitch (the center to center distance between microfeatures), and feature height. Surface heat flux and surface superheat, the difference between the heated surface and the pool saturation temperature, were measured for each surface. Ten different micropatterned surfaces with post or rib geometries were considered with cavity fraction varying from 0.5 to 0.98, pitch varying from 8 to 40 _m, and microfeature height at 4 _m or 15 _m.

Increasing the microstructure height from 4 _m to 15 _m modestly increases the transition temperature. Nucleate boiling is more suppressed on post patterned surfaces than on rib patterned surfaces. Further, the rib structured surfaces exhibit a sudden transition from nucleate to film boiling while the post structured surfaces exhibit a gradual transition, with the vapor film growing slowly across the surface.

While a large body of work exists on droplet impingement on hydrophilic and superhydrophilic surfaces, impingement on the latter two has been largely neglected and the present results show that dynamics are dramatically different. Experiments ranging in surface temperature from 125¡C to 415¡C and Weber numbers from 10 to 225 were performed and analyzed using high-speed imaging. Some of the most striking differences are as follows. While atomization is always present for impingement on the hydrophilic and superhydrophilic surfaces at temperatures below the Leidenfrost point, atomization is absent at low Weber numbers and at low excess surface temperatures on the hydrophobic surface. At high surface temperatures, the attraction of vapor bubbles on the hydrophobic surface allows a vapor blanket to form more readily thus leading to Leidenfrost behavior at a much lower temperature than classically observed on a hydrophilic surface. One of the most interesting phenomenon that will be discussed includes what will be described as a Òpseudo-LeidenfrostÓ state for impingement on the superhydrophobic surface. Because water can be suspended at the peaks of the roughness on a superhydrophobic interface, vapor escapes from underneath the droplet thus mimicking Leidenfrost behavior for all excess temperatures. This results in minimal atomization for superhydrophobic impingement over the entire regime explored. Finally, maximum spread diameters for Leidenfrost impingement are tabulated as a function of the Weber number for all surfaces and are shown to be larger on the smooth surfaces than on the textured ones indicating that droplet spreading at the Leidenfrost point is not independent of surface type as previously supposed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Boiling; Droplet impingement; Superhydrophobic,Data management; Boundary conditions; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Heat convection; Heat flux; Hydrodynamics; Hydrophobicity; Jets; Liquids; Nusselt number; Polonium compounds; Prandtl number; Sulfur compounds; Surface properties; Thin films; Convective heat transfer; Jet impingement; Slip length; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Temperature jump; Fighter aircraft,Journal,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009936506

Circular micropillars 4 _m in height with varying center-to-center distances (pitch) of 8 _m, 12 _m and 16 _m, are used to create the superhydrophobic surfaces. The range of surface temperatures explored is 110¡C&lt;Ts&lt;337¡C. An image processing algorithm was developed to quantify the temporal behavior of thermally induced atomization captured via high-speed photography. Results show thermally induced atomization is initially absent (&lt;1 ms following impact) on all surfaces. The amount of ejected droplets later during droplet spreading is determined as a function of surface structuring and temperature. Atomization ceases when the surface has cooled sufficiently (2.5Ð4 ms depending on the surface). The maximum amount of atomization for a given scenario is highly dependent on surface temperature and surface microstructure characteristics. At low surface temperatures, atomization increases with increasing surface temperature; however at high surface temperatures atomization decreases with increasing surface temperature. This rise and fall behavior is tantamount to the classical relationship between heat flux and surface temperature for pool boiling. Both droplet impingement and pool boiling depend on vapor bubble formation dynamics and the stability of the so-called Leidenfrost vapor film, which is impacted by surface wettability. Results also show that small surface pitch causes a high atomization intensity, indicating that not all superhydrophobic surfaces sustain Leidenfrost-like behavior at all excess temperatures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,Data management; Boundary conditions; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Heat convection; Heat flux; Hydrodynamics; Hydrophobicity; Jets; Liquids; Nusselt number; Polonium compounds; Prandtl number; Sulfur compounds; Surface properties; Thin films; Convective heat transfer; Jet impingement; Slip length; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Temperature jump; Fighter aircraft,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048962910

All surfaces tested were submerged in a 20 mm deep pool of water and heated from below to maintain a constant surface temperature, while the side walls of the pool were insulated, and the top was covered. Three thermocouples positioned in the pool obtain the average pool temperature. A heat flux sensor is placed directly beneath the surface to measure the heat flux supplied to the pool. Free convection heat transfer coefficients are obtained for the sub-boiling temperature range of 40Ð90 ¡C. Six surface types are studied: smooth hydrophilic, smooth hydrophobic, superhydrophobic with rib/cavity structures, superhydrophobic with rib/cavity structures and additional sparsely spaced ribs to close off the cavities, circular posts, and circular holes. It is found that structured superhydrophobic surfaces provide cavities for nucleation to occur. More dissolved air effervesces from the water as the surface temperature increases due to an increased level of supersaturation and convection. The nucleation leads to large air bubble formations that reduce the overall convection coefficient when compared to the smooth surfaces. For the rib/cavity structured surfaces, the bubbles form in an anisotropic manner and are aligned with the surface structure. More bubbles are observed on the superhydrophobic surfaces where the cavities are bounded. Since water's ability to dissolve air is dependent on temperature, heat and mass transfer cannot be treated independently on any of the superhydrophobic surfaces studied here. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Natural convection; Nucleation; Superhydrophobic,Data management; Boundary conditions; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Heat convection; Heat flux; Hydrodynamics; Hydrophobicity; Jets; Liquids; Nusselt number; Polonium compounds; Prandtl number; Sulfur compounds; Surface properties; Thin films; Convective heat transfer; Jet impingement; Slip length; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Temperature jump; Fighter aircraft,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054812469

When water that is saturated with air is used as the working liquid, the non-wetted cavities on the superhydrophobic surfaces act as nucleation sites and allow air to effervesce out of the water and onto the surface when heated. Previous works in the literature have only considered the opposite case where the water is undersaturated and absorbs air out the cavities for a microchannel setting. The microchannel considered in this work consists of a rib/cavity structured superhydrophobic surface and a glass surface separated by spacers. The microchannel is 60 mm long by 14 mm wide and two channel heights of nominally 183 _m and 366 _m are explored. The superhydrophobic side is in contact with a heated aluminum block and a camera is used to visualize the flow through the glass side. Thermocouples are embedded in the aluminum to record the temperature profile along the length of the channel. Temperatures are maintained below the boiling temperature of the working liquid. The friction factor-Reynolds product (fRe) is obtained via pressure drop and volumetric flow-rate measurements. Five surface types/configurations are investigated: smooth hydrophilic, smooth hydrophobic, superhydrophobic with ribs perpendicular to the flow, superhydrophobic with ribs parallel to the flow, and superhydrophobic with ribs parallel to the flow with several breaker ridges perpendicular to the flow. The surface type/configuration has a significant impact on the mass transport dynamics. For surfaces with closed cell micro-structures, large bubbles eventually form and adversely affect fRe and lead to higher temperatures along the channel. When degassed water is used, no bubble nucleation is observed and the air initially trapped in the superhydrophobic cavities is quickly absorbed by the water. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Convection; Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Microchannel; Nucleation; Superhydrophobic,Data management; Boundary conditions; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Heat convection; Heat flux; Hydrodynamics; Hydrophobicity; Jets; Liquids; Nusselt number; Polonium compounds; Prandtl number; Sulfur compounds; Surface properties; Thin films; Convective heat transfer; Jet impingement; Slip length; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Temperature jump; Fighter aircraft,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039982303

A discrete ordinates method is used to solve the radiative heat transfer equation with radiative properties calculated using a weighted-sum-of-grey-gases (WSGG) model for gases and Mie and Rayleigh theory for particles including fuel, ash and soot. Measurement data gathered from a pilot-scale test furnace, comprising temperature, gas composition and particle concentration, is used in combination with temperature data and operation parameters gathered from a conventional rotary kiln to model a full-scale rotary kiln with a present bed material. The modelled cases have a thermal input of about 37 MWth and in addition to radiative heat transfer, conductive heat transfer within, as well as between, the bed and wall material are included in the model along with convective heat transfer from the gas and heat release from exothermic reactions in the bed. The model also considers the rotational wall and includes a simplified mixing model of the bed material as well as heat losses from the outside wall of the rotary kiln due to radiation and convection. For two different flames, one coal and one oil flame, surface temperatures are calculated on the inside and outside of the rotary kiln and compared to measurements. The model appears to predict the inner wall and bed surface temperatures well with errors less than 11%. The total heat transfer to the present bed material was also studied revealing that more than 80% originated from the radiative heat transfer within the furnace. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Discrete ordinates method; Heat transfer; Iron ore; Rotary Kiln,Boundary conditions; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Heat convection; Heat flux; Hydrodynamics; Hydrophobicity; Jets; Liquids; Nusselt number; Polonium compounds; Prandtl number; Sulfur compounds; Surface properties; Thin films; Convective heat transfer; Jet impingement; Slip length; Super-hydrophobic surfaces; Temperature jump; Fighter aircraft,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075513133

The Brazilian technical standard for clay masonry blocks aiming at attaining greater agility and flexibility in the construction process allows the use of bedding mortar instead of grout to fill the cells of the blocks. In this context, the objective of this study was to evaluate the mechanical behaviour of prisms filled with bedding mortar. Six classes of mortar and one type of clay block with nominal resistance of 6 MPa were studied. The results of the compressive strength of the prisms indicate the viability of using bedding mortar with the same structural function as grout. This article presents also an analytical study to evaluate the mechanical behaviour of clay block prisms filled with mortar. Analyses were conducted using general-purpose, nonlinear finite element software that simulates structural behaviour under different loading scenarios. A three-dimensional model of the prisms was developed using eight-node brick elements for both block and mortar with nonlinear properties assigned to each material.

Particles with different diameters are injected onto the centerline of a turbulent air jet. The particles are passive and do not impact the fluid phase. Their radial dispersion and axial velocities are obtained as functions of axial position. The time and length scales of the jet are varied through control of the jet exit velocity and nozzle diameter. Dispersion data at long times of flight for the nozzle diameter (7Êmm), particle diameters (60 and 90Êµm), and Reynolds numbers (10, 000Ð30, 000) are analyzed to obtain the Lagrangian particle dispersivity.

The experimental results showed that the two shoulder profiles caused significant differences in the axial force, the mixing of materials, and the mechanical properties of the joint. The sensitivity of joint strength to the variation of the tool rotation speed and the plunge speed was also quite dependent on the shoulder profile.

This antagonistic structure allows the simultaneous control of position and stiffness. However, dynamic models of soft robots that allow variable stiffness control have not been well developed. In this work, a model that includes stiffness as a state variable is developed and validated.

For model predictive control (MPC) the joint stiffness was controlled to within 0.045 Nm/rad of the same stiffness command. Both SMC and MPC were able to control to within 0.5¡ of a desired position at steady state. Stiffness control was extended to a multiple-degree-of-freedom soft robot using MPC. Controlling stiffness of a 4-DOF arm reduced the end-effector deflection by approximately 50% (from 17.9 to 12.2cm) with a 4 lb (1.8 kg) step input applied at the end effector when higher joint stiffness (40 Nm/rad) was used compared with low stiffness (30 Nm/rad).

The filter fuses data from an inertial measurement unit and altimeter with relative-pose updates from a keyframe-based visual odometry or laser scan-matching algorithm. Because the global position and heading states of the vehicle are unobservable in the absence of global measurements such as GPS, the filter in this article estimates the state with respect to a local frame that is colocated with the odometry keyframe. As a result, the odometry update provides nearly direct measurements of the relative vehicle pose, making those states observable. Recent publications have rigorously documented the theoretical advantages of such an observable parameterization, including improved consistency, accuracy, and system robustness, and have demonstrated the effectiveness of such an approach during prolonged multirotor flight tests. This article complements this prior work by providing a complete, self-contained, tutorial derivation of the relative MEKF, which has been thoroughly motivated but only briefly described to date. This article presents several improvements and extensions to the filter while clearly defining all quaternion conventions and properties used, including several new useful properties relating to error quaternions and their Euler-angle decomposition. Finally, this article derives the filter both for traditional dynamics defined with respect to an inertial frame, and for robocentric dynamics defined with respect to the vehicleÕs body frame, and provides insights into the subtle differences that arise between the two formulations. © The Author(s) 2020.",aerial robotics; multiplicative extended Kalman filter; Sensor fusion; vision-aided inertial navigation,Agricultural robots; Global positioning system; Vehicles; Direct measurement; Global measurements; GPS-denied navigations; Inertial measurement unit; Laser scan matching; Multiplicative extended kalman filters; System robustness; Useful properties; Extended Kalman filters,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086771236

The ability to interact meaningfully with 3D computer-aided engineering models in these VR design reviews is an important, though often neglected, capability due to the difficulty of performing data translation between native computer-aided design (CAD) data and VR compatible file formats. A bi-directional interface was developed between a VR design review environment and a commercial CAD package that streamlines the data translation process. Transmitting both geometric data and selected metadata from the CAD system enabled the development of enhanced model interaction tools in a VR design review application. User experiments were performed that compared the enhanced tools developed to a baseline toolset. Participants success using these toolsets was measured as they performed tasks related to design understanding and decision making, such as counting the number of gears in a gearbox or evaluating the feasibility of a proposed design change in a four-cylinder engine.

The ability to interact meaningfully with 3D computer-aided engineering models in these VR design reviews is an important, though often neglected, capability due to the difficulty of performing data translation between native computer-aided design (CAD) data and VR compatible file formats. A bi-directional interface was developed between a VR design review environment and a commercial CAD package that streamlines the data translation process. Transmitting both geometric data and selected metadata from the CAD system enabled the development of enhanced model interaction tools in a VR design review application. User experiments were performed that compared the enhanced tools developed to a baseline toolset. Participants success using these toolsets was measured as they performed tasks related to design understanding and decision making, such as counting the number of gears in a gearbox or evaluating the feasibility of a proposed design change in a four-cylinder engine.

In particular, electronics can be embedded directly into structural components in nearly arbitrary 3D space. While these methods incorporate many of the same materials, the new processing methods require standard test methods to compare materials, processing conditions, and determine design limits. This work demonstrates a test method to quantitatively measure the adhesion failure of printed inks deposited on a substrate without changing the ink printing conditions. The proposed method is an adaption of single lap shear testing in which the lap joint is created by bonding the second substrate to the ink after curing. It was found that the interfacial shear strengths are independent of the adhesives used to attach cured conductive ink to the second substrate. In addition, chemical surface treatments of flame and plasma and mechanical sand-blasting increase the interfacial shear strengths by ~25% and 80%, respectively, while altering the adhesive failure mode to cohesive failure for most cases. This work also shows extruded substrates with undulated features increase adhesion strength; therefore, in addition to surface treatments, the geometric freedom of additive manufacturing (AM) could be leveraged to design surface features for enhanced adhesion. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Additive manufacturing; adhesion; conductive inks; printed electronics; single lap shear testing; surface treatments,3D printers; Additives; Adhesion; Adhesives; Chemical bonds; Conductive materials; Curing; Plasma theory; Processing; Soldered joints; Surface testing; Surface treatment; Testing; Adhesive failure modes; Conductive ink; Electronics manufacturing; Interfacial shear strength; Printed electronics; Processing condition; Single lap shears; Structural component; Substrates,Journal,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073973593

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer an attractive alternative to supporting and defending various threats at borders. This paper applies a differential game to define a border defense scenario where one UAV (pursuer) seeks to capture two intruders (evaders) before they reach a designated border. The evaders can be UAVs, marine or ground vehicles, or human agents, but they have a lower maximum speed than the pursuer throughout the game. Simple motion is assumed for the pursuer and evaders with complete state information shared across all agents. The game is played within a rectangular area with a parallel top and bottom border of length L and left and right borders with a length of W, for a game aspect ratio of L_W. The value of the game is the minimum distance to the bottom border achieved by the evaders at any time before capture of both evaders. Within the region where the pursuer wins, the game of degree is explored and the optimal policy for both the evaders and pursuer is derived using geometric properties. © 2020 by John Salmon.

To safely avoid another aircraft, an unmanned aircraft must detect the intruder aircraft with ample time and distance to allow the ownship to track the intruder, perform risk assessment, plan an avoidance path, and execute the maneuver. This paper describes two analytical methods for finding the minimum detection range to ensure that these detection and avoidance steps can be carried out. The first method, time-based geometric velocity vectors, includes the bank-angle dynamics of the ownship; whereas the second, geometric velocity vectors, assumes an instantaneous bank-angle maneuver. The solution using the first method must be found numerically, whereas the second has a closed-form analytical solution. These methods are compared to two existing methods. The results show the time-based geometric velocity vectors approach is precise, the geometric velocity vectors approach is a good approximation under many conditions, and the two existing approaches are good approximations at large ownship speeds relative to the intruder speed, fast ownship bank-angle transients, and small ownship bank angles.

As usage becomes more widespread, airspace will become increasingly crowded. These high-density unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) situations will pose many unique challenges, including in conflict resolution. Using agent-based models, conflict resolution and the well-clear and action-distance concepts for small multirotor UAVs in dense environments were explored. Specifically, the safety and efficiency of several collision-avoidance mechanisms under different possible densities, accelerations, and action distances were investigated. The results suggest that selecting appropriate action distances and collision-avoidance mechanisms will be vital to maintaining safety and efficiency. Interestingly, excessive action distances quickly degrade performance: using a simple method under high-density conditions (1 UAV_km2), well-clear distances above approximately 750 m have extremely low efficiency (_1% as many deliveries accomplished in 5000 simulation hours compared to lower distances).

Distributed electric propulsion could potentially decrease takeoff distances enough to enable thousands of potential intercity runways. This conceptual study explores the effects of a retrofit of open-bladed electric propulsion units. To model and explore the design space, blade element momentum method, vortex lattice method, linear-beam finite element analysis, classical laminate theory, composite failure, empirically based blade noise modeling, motor and motor-controller mass models, and gradient-based optimization are used. With liftoff time of seconds and the safe total field length for this aircraft type undefined, this paper focused on the minimum conceptual takeoff distance. It was found that 16 propellers could reduce the takeoff distance by over 50% compared with the optimal 2-propeller case. This resulted in a conceptual minimum takeoff distance of 20.5 m to clear a 50 ft (15.24 m) obstacle. It was also found that, when decreasing the allowable noise by approximately 10 dBa, the 8-propeller case performed the best with a 43% reduction in takeoff distance compared with the optimal 2-propeller case. This resulted in a noise-restricted conceptual minimum takeoff distance of 95 m. Copyright © 2019 by Kevin R. Moore and Andrew Ning.

Surveys of irregular satellites and minor bodies are where WFIRST will excel with its 0.28 deg2 field-of-view Wide Field Instrument. Potential groundbreaking discoveries from WFIRST could include detection of the first minor bodies orbiting in the inner Oort Cloud, identification of additional Earth Trojan asteroids, and the discovery and characterization of asteroid binary systems similar to Ida/Dactyl. Additional investigations into asteroids, giant planet satellites, Trojan asteroids, Centaurs, Kuiper belt objects, and comets are presented.

Labeled proteins can then be selectively conjugated to fluorophores, affinity reagents, peptides, polymers, nanoparticles or surfaces for a wide variety of downstream applications in proteomics and biotechnology. In this review, we focus on techniques in which proteins are residue- and site-specifically labeled with ncAAs containing bioorthogonal handles. These ncAA-labeled proteins are: readily enriched from cells and tissues for identification via mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis; selectively purified for downstream biotechnology applications; or labeled with fluorophores for in situ analysis. To facilitate the wider use of these techniques, we provide decision trees to help guide the design of future experiments. It is expected that the use of ncAA labeling will continue to expand into new application areas where spatial and temporal analysis of proteome dynamics and engineering new chemistries and new function into proteins are desired. © 2019 The Author(s).",Bioorthogonal chemistry; Biotechnology; Metabolic labeling; Proteomics; Residue-specific labeling; Site-specific labeling,proteome; transfer RNA; amino acid labeling; amino terminal sequence; bioengineering; biotechnology; chemical labeling; chemical structure; click chemistry; cycloaddition; decision tree; disulfide bond; mass spectrometry; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein synthesis; proteomics; quorum sensing; Review; structure activity relation,Journal,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067181145

The moderately hydrophobic drug latanoprost was rapidly loaded in 4 min by swelling contact lenses in a solution of the drug in n-propanol. A fraction of the drug was radiolabeled, thus allowing measurement of the uptake and subsequent release of drug into artificial tear fluid. Three questions were addressed: (1) how much drug can be loaded into each type of lens, (2) how fast is drug release, and (3) how are these values related to the contact lens chemistry. The results showed that much more latanoprost could be loaded into SiHy lenses than a conventional contact lens of poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate). The drug uptake correlated with the amount of swelling in n-propanol, with Galyfilcon lenses having the greatest swelling and highest drug uptake. The drug release from the SiHy lenses occurred over days, whereas the conventional lens released nearly all drug in a burst over a few hours. To examine correlations between lens chemistry, drug chemistry and uptake, and solvent chemistry, the Hansen solubility parameters were calculated using estimates of contact lens chemistry. These results showed that drug uptake in SiHy lenses correlated with favorable solubility parameter interactions between the n-propanol and the lens material, but did not correlate with interactions between the drug and the lens materials. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",drug delivery; latanoprost; Silicone hydrogel contact lens; swelling,Contact lenses; Drug delivery; Hydrogels; Propanol; Silicones; Solubility; Swelling; Targeted drug delivery; Artificial tears; Conventional lens; Hansen solubility parameters; latanoprost; Poly hydroxy ethyl methacrylates; Silicone hydrogels; Solubility parameters; Solvent chemistries; Controlled drug delivery; alpha tocopherol; galyfilcon A; latanoprost; propanol; trichloroethylene; Article; drug release; drug uptake; priority journal; swelling,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073989024

Unfortunately, the methodology for in vivo measurements of whole-arm movements using EM sensors is not well described in the literature, making it difficult to perform new measurements and all but impossible to make meaningful comparisons between studies. The recommendations of the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) have provided a great service, but by necessity they do not provide clear guidance or standardization on all required steps. The goal of this paper was to provide a comprehensive methodology for using EM sensors to measure whole-arm movements in vivo. We selected methodological details from past studies that were compatible with the ISB recommendations and suitable for measuring whole-arm movements using EM sensors, filling in gaps with recommendations from our own past experiments. The presented methodology includes recommendations for defining coordinate systems (CSs) and joint angles, placing sensors, performing sensor-to-body calibration, calculating rotation matrices from sensor data, and extracting unique joint angles from rotation matrices. We present this process, including all equations, for both the right and left upper limbs, models with nine or seven degrees-of-freedom (DOF), and two different calibration methods. Providing a detailed methodology for the entire process in one location promotes replicability of studies by allowing researchers to clearly define their experimental methods. It is hoped that this paper will simplify new investigations of whole-arm movement using EM sensors and facilitate comparison between studies. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Creating effective tremor suppression devices requires a knowledge of where tremor originates mechanically (which muscles) and how it propagates through the limb (to which degrees-of-freedom (DOF)). To simulate tremor propagation, we created a simple model of the upper limb, with tremorogenic activity in the 15 major superficial muscles as inputs and tremulous joint displacement in the seven major DOF as outputs. The model approximated the muscle excitation-contraction dynamics, musculoskeletal geometry, and mechanical impedance of the limb. From our simulations, we determined fundamental principles for tremor propagation: (1) The distribution of tremor depends strongly on musculoskeletal dynamics. (2) The spreading of tremor is due to inertial coupling (primarily) and musculoskeletal geometry (secondarily). (3) Tremorogenic activity in a given muscle causes significant tremor in only a small subset of DOF, though these affected DOF may be distant from the muscle. (4) Assuming uniform distribution of tremorogenic activity among muscles, tremor increases proximal-distally, and the contribution from muscles increases proximal-distally. (5) Although adding inertia (e.g., with weighted utensils) is often used to suppress tremor, it is possible to increase tremor by adding inertia to the wrong DOF.

Unfortunately, the methodology for in vivo measurements of whole-arm movements using EM sensors is not well described in the literature, making it difficult to perform new measurements and all but impossible to make meaningful comparisons between studies. The recommendations of the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) have provided a great service, but by necessity they do not provide clear guidance or standardization on all required steps. The goal of this paper was to provide a comprehensive methodology for using EM sensors to measure whole-arm movements in vivo. We selected methodological details from past studies that were compatible with the ISB recommendations and suitable for measuring whole-arm movements using EM sensors, filling in gaps with recommendations from our own past experiments. The presented methodology includes recommendations for defining coordinate systems (CSs) and joint angles, placing sensors, performing sensor-to-body calibration, calculating rotation matrices from sensor data, and extracting unique joint angles from rotation matrices. We present this process, including all equations, for both the right and left upper limbs, models with nine or seven degrees-of-freedom (DOF), and two different calibration methods. Providing a detailed methodology for the entire process in one location promotes replicability of studies by allowing researchers to clearly define their experimental methods. It is hoped that this paper will simplify new investigations of whole-arm movement using EM sensors and facilitate comparison between studies. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Creating effective tremor suppression devices requires a knowledge of where tremor originates mechanically (which muscles) and how it propagates through the limb (to which degrees-of-freedom (DOF)). To simulate tremor propagation, we created a simple model of the upper limb, with tremorogenic activity in the 15 major superficial muscles as inputs and tremulous joint displacement in the seven major DOF as outputs. The model approximated the muscle excitation-contraction dynamics, musculoskeletal geometry, and mechanical impedance of the limb. From our simulations, we determined fundamental principles for tremor propagation: (1) The distribution of tremor depends strongly on musculoskeletal dynamics. (2) The spreading of tremor is due to inertial coupling (primarily) and musculoskeletal geometry (secondarily). (3) Tremorogenic activity in a given muscle causes significant tremor in only a small subset of DOF, though these affected DOF may be distant from the muscle. (4) Assuming uniform distribution of tremorogenic activity among muscles, tremor increases proximal-distally, and the contribution from muscles increases proximal-distally. (5) Although adding inertia (e.g., with weighted utensils) is often used to suppress tremor, it is possible to increase tremor by adding inertia to the wrong DOF. (6) Similarly, adding viscoelasticity to the wrong DOF can increase tremor.

Short, disc-shaped stalk segments were used for this purpose. X-ray computed tomography was used to obtain the geometry of each specimen prior to testing. Each specimen was tested in two different configurations. Computed tomography data was used to create a specimen-specific finite element model of each test specimen. Data from the first testing configuration was used in conjunction with the finite element model to determine the Young's Modulus values for each specimen. The specimen-specific finite element models provided estimates of the stress states in the stem under transverse loading, and these stress states accurately predicted the location of failure in transverse test specimens. The entire testing method was validated using data from one test configuration to predict the structural response of each specimen during the second test configuration. © 2018",Finite element modeling; Stiffness; Tissue properties; Transverse compression; Young's modulus,"Computerized tomography; Elastic moduli; Histology; Stiffness; Stress analysis; Testing; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Computed tomography data; Specific finite element; Structural response; Testing configurations; Tissue properties; Transverse compression; Transverse Young's modulus; X-ray computed tomography; Finite element method; article; compression; geometry; human tissue; maize; nonhuman; rigidity; stress; x-ray computed tomography; biomechanics; finite element analysis; mechanical stress; physiology; Young modulus; Biomechanical Phenomena; Elastic Modulus; Finite Element Analysis; Stress, Mechanical; Zea mays",Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059563555

The present study deals with the seismic responses of bridge-abutment transition backfills (BATBs), which are essential components of HSR bridges. BATBs provide a gradual variation of vertical stiffness between the bridge deck and nominal engineered backfill, enabling smooth operations for trains traveling at high speeds. All prior investigations focused on this vertical stiffness in order to better characterize the localized vertical differential movements around BATBs under periodic high axial loads from train sets. Lateral behavior of BATBs, which would be important under seismic loads, has not previously been investigated. The present study offers a parametric nonlinear lateral force-displacement backbone curve for BATBs that is verified against three-dimensional finite-element models and validated against data from large-scale tests conducted at Brigham Young University.

Specifically, a two-stage process was used to maximize the use of the carbon in coal or increase the carbon monoxide yield or lower carbon dioxide and methane yields. Carbon dioxide-char gasification in the absence of water can generate carbon monoxide with near-zero methane, which is desired to produce high-carbon and low-hydrogen chemicals such as oxalic acid through catalytic carbon monoxide coupling and hydrolysis. The technology is applicable to any coal, although Power River Basin (PRB) coal is used as an example feedstock in this research Also, the sodium-iron catalyst can accelerate not only the reaction kinetics in both stages but also increase the hydrogen/carbon monoxide ratio in the syngas produced in the second stage. In other words, the catalyst is a multifunctional agent, which can not only intensify the overall coal process efficiency but also improve the qualities of the desired syngas products and reduce carbon dioxide emission. Thus, In the 1st stage, the catalysts can significantly reduce the CO2-char gasification by as high as 75.00%. In the 2nd stage, the H2/CO ratio of ideal syngas is _2:1 with near-0 CH4 generation and the CH4 production can be reduced as high as 61.29% for the CO2ÐH2O-Char coal gasification.

Additionally, we examine the roles of technological turbulence and environmental dynamic capability. We have administered a cross-sectional (time lag) survey design with 229 respondents from 31 manufacturing organisations in Malaysia and employed the partial least square path modelling (SmartPLS3) for data analysis. Results indicate that technological turbulence, green recruitment and selection and green training, involvement and development are positive predictors of green team creativity. Green performance and compensation negatively predict green team creativity. While green team creativity positively predicts green product innovation, environmental dynamic capability negatively predicts green product innovation. Technological turbulence reinforces the positive impact of green recruitment and selection on green team creativity and dampens the positive impact of green training, involvement and development on green team creativity. Furthermore, green team creativity is a complementary and competitive mediator. By simultaneously investigating the predictive powers of technological turbulence, green team creativity and environmental dynamic capability in our study, we offer novel insights that extend traditional HRM conceptualisations to reflect a more environmentally sustainable GHRM framework.

The most significant roadblock to industryÕs implementation of LCM is the usually higher void content compared with prepreg processing. One tool for reducing void levels in LCM involves optimization of flow velocity, which requires models to be developed to describe void formation at a given velocity. To help solve this problem, the following research illustrates the first known method for optical void measurement in situ during infusion in a carbon fiber reinforcement. Similar to previous studies on glass fiber, this work utilizes fluorescent dye and a digital camera to produce sufficient contrast and resolution for image analysis. Visible bubbles are photographed against the opaque carbon fiber background. An automated method of image analysis is outlined, which was used to analyze 230 images for three different flow orientations of a single fabric, producing the highest amount of experimental data seen so far on in situ void measurement. The resulting data identifies a minimum velocity threshold for minimal macro-void formation. The resultant void characterization framework will better enable optimization of LCM processing for high-performance composites based on carbon reinforcements. © The Author(s) 2020.",bubble; flow optimization; in situ; LCM; Void,Flow velocity; Graphite fibers; Optical data processing; Autoclave methods; Automated methods; Carbon reinforcements; Flow orientations; High performance composites; Liquid composite molding; Minimum velocities; Optical measurement; Image analysis,Journal,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091027375

Experimental results are presented for quasi-static loading in combination with high-resolution tomographic imaging and statistical analysis (homology of pores or voids and induced cracks). Three distinct mechanisms were observed to control delamination growth in the presence of sharp and blunt voids. Delamination cracks interact with the supporting yarns, especially in combination with air pockets trapped in the resin in the form of long, sharp voids. This resulted in crack growth that coalesces with delamination cracks from neighbouring yarn-voids during increased out-of-plane loadÐdisplacement, with almost no presence of intralaminar transverse cracks. This highlights the benefits and drawbacks of the supporting yarn during out-of-plane loading. © The Author(s) 2019.",CT analysis; damage mechanics; porosity; Resin transfer moulding,Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Computerized tomography; Cracks; Polymers; Porosity; Reinforcement; Resin transfer molding; Resins; Wool; Yarn; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Damage mechanics; Delamination growth; Out-of-plane loading; Quasi-static indentation; Quasi-static loading; Reinforced polymers; Tomographic imaging; Loading,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068251737

Devices such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Leap Motionª Controller, and Microsoft Kinect¨ are bringing immersive VR experiences into the homes of consumers with much lower cost and space requirements than previous generations of VR hardware. These new devices are also lowering the barrier to entry for VR engineering applications. Past research has suggested that there are significant opportunities for using VR during design tasks to improve results and reduce development time. This work reviews the latest generation of VR hardware and reviews research studying VR in the design process. Additionally, this work extracts the major themes from the reviews and discusses how the latest technology and research may affect the engineering design process. We conclude that these new devices have the potential to significantly improve portions of the design process.

This paper reports on a national study of over 80 transportation owners and designers to measure their perceptions of the three most widely used delivery methods: design bid build (DBB), construction manager at risk (CMAR), and design build (DB). The study develops a list of factors that influence the selection of a delivery method, and then tests the most significant factors that lead to the selection of each individual method. Analyses using Fisher's least significant difference intervals and multiple range tests allow for the identification of specific correlations between the delivery method and motivating factors or project goals.

Vessel operation in water environments can be enhanced by routing algorithms that integrate mission parameters with environmental data and vessel specifications. These algorithms must update predetermined routes in a timely manner as parameters and specifications change. The US Army Engineer Research and Development Center Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory is developing the capability for military planners to rapidly optimize vessel routes in water environments by extending capabilities of the Rapid Operational Access and Maneuver Support (ROAMS) modeling platform. The ROAMS platform allows users to rapidly generate models of a water environment in limited-information conditions, utilizing the Adaptive Hydraulics and STeady-state spectral WAVE computational engines for the base two-dimensional hydrodynamics and waves, respectively. Routing capabilities are built on path search and penalty-barrier optimization to automatically produce routes that account for temporally changing environmental variables and vessel maneuverability.

Concurrent advancements in computational power, continuum theory, and experimental diagnostics are enabling unprecedented understanding of such interactions. However, we cannot develop a sufficient level of confidence in such mesoscale capability until the constitutive description of the underlying constituents is reliably representative of their actual physical behavior. Therefore, there is a strong need to combine experimental, modeling, and data-science techniques to validate models of the thermomechanical response of individual single crystals. One experimental diagnostic with high potential impact to shock physics and materials science is in-situ x-ray diffraction. This paper is primarily focused on simulation of x-ray diffraction in shock physics, but with an aim toward quantifying parametric uncertainty of simulation models. We develop and demonstrate a data-science and model-driven approach to constrain the parameterization of continuum models of crystal lattice deformation associated with the shock response of crystalline materials. The framework is built around the connection between continuum hydrodynamic simulations of lattice deformation and a new Bragg diffraction simulation code, BarberShop. The dynamic deformation of a crystal lattice is modeled using the DiscoFlux model within an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian hydrodynamic code, FLAG. These detailed continuum simulations of lattice deformation can be computationally slow, thus a statistical model is used to emulate the evolution of lattice deformation fields in time and across the considered model parameter space. Emulated lattice deformation fields can then be generated rapidly for any combination of physics model parameters. In turn, these fields can be fed into BarberShop to realize a rapid prediction of Bragg diffraction patterns associated with particular values of physics model parameters. The framework enables parameterization of the single crystal model to obtain Bragg diffraction patterns that most closely resemble a corresponding measurement. Furthermore, the framework naturally provides sensitivities of the lattice deformation to the physics parameters. We highlight the utility of this framework through the application to a synthetic closed-loop inverse problem leading to the parameterization of a single crystal material model.

One method to enable this adaptivity is to select the most representative model from a set of Òpre-agedÓ models that represent the characteristics of the cell as different cyclic and calendar aging processes occur. By modeling the aging of a cell as a Markovian process, an interacting multiple-model Kalman filter (IMM) can be utilized to determine a time-varying probability mass function that specifies the probability that each of the models under consideration is the best representation of the cell under observation. While the output of the IMM is useful by itself, its predictions can be improved by post-processing. In this paper, we present methods to analyze the time-series probability mass function produced by the IMM using the Viterbi and BCJR algorithms in common use in the digital-communications discipline. These algorithms seek to identify the Òbest pathÓ through the space of available models over time, based on the likelihoods produced by the IMM and the Markovian transition probabilities. Through the use of these post-processing algorithms, confidence in the best-fitting model can be improved. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Aged parameter estimation; Battery management systems; BCJR Algorithm; Interacting multiple model Kalman filter; Lithium ion battery; Viterbi algorithm,Battery management systems; Digital communication systems; Functions; Ions; Kalman filters; Probability; Viterbi algorithm; BCJR algorithm; Digital communications; Interacting multiple model; Markovian process; Post processing; Postprocessing algorithms; Probability mass function; Transition probabilities; Lithium-ion batteries,Journal,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074630040

Often these analogies require approximations, but in the limit of large radii where TCF becomes rotating plane Couette flow (RPC) exact relations can be established. When the flows are restricted to two spatial independent variables, there is an exact specification that maps the three velocity components in RPC to the two velocity components and one temperature field in RBC. Using this, we deduce several relations between both flows: (i) heat and angular momentum transport differ by, explaining why angular momentum transport is not symmetric around even though the relation between, the Rayleigh number, and, a non-dimensional measure of the rotation, has this symmetry. This relationship leads to a predicted value of that maximizes the angular momentum transport that agrees remarkably well with existing numerical simulations of the full three-dimensional system. (ii) One variable in both flows satisfies a maximum principle, i.e. the fields' extrema occur at the walls. Accordingly, backflow events in shear flow cannot occur in this quasi two-dimensional setting.

While cavity dynamics has been studied for over a century, this work focuses on the water entry characteristics of deformable elastomeric spheres, which has not been studied. Upon free surface impact, an elastomeric sphere deforms significantly, giving rise to large-scale material oscillations within the sphere resulting in unique nested cavities. We study these phenomena experimentally with high-speed imaging and image processing techniques. The water entry behaviour of deformable spheres differs from rigid spheres because of the pronounced deformation caused at impact as well as the subsequent material vibration. Our results show that this deformation and vibration can be predicted from material properties and impact conditions. Additionally, by accounting for the sphere deformation in an effective diameter term, we recover previously reported characteristics for time to cavity pinch off and hydrodynamic force coefficients for rigid spheres. Our results also show that velocity change over the first oscillation period scales with the dimensionless ratio of material shear modulus to impact hydrodynamic pressure. Therefore, we are able to describe the water entry characteristics of deformable spheres in terms of material properties and impact conditions. © 2017 Cambridge University Presså.",aerodynamics; flow-structure interactions; interfacial flows (free surface),Aerodynamics; Air; Deformation; Fluid dynamics; Hydrodynamics; Image processing; Shear flow; Dimensionless ratios; Effective diameter; Flow-structure interaction; High speed imaging; Hydrodynamic forces; Impact hydrodynamic pressure; Interfacial flow (free surface); Oscillation periods; Spheres; aerodynamics; deformation; fluid mechanics; free surface flow; impact; interface; rigidity; sphere,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023752137

Often these analogies require approximations, but in the limit of large radii where TCF becomes rotating plane Couette flow (RPC) exact relations can be established. When the flows are restricted to two spatial independent variables, there is an exact specification that maps the three velocity components in RPC to the two velocity components and one temperature field in RBC. Using this, we deduce several relations between both flows: (i) heat and angular momentum transport differ by, explaining why angular momentum transport is not symmetric around even though the relation between, the Rayleigh number, and, a non-dimensional measure of the rotation, has this symmetry. This relationship leads to a predicted value of that maximizes the angular momentum transport that agrees remarkably well with existing numerical simulations of the full three-dimensional system. (ii) One variable in both flows satisfies a maximum principle, i.e. the fields' extrema occur at the walls. Accordingly, backflow events in shear flow cannot occur in this quasi two-dimensional setting. (iii) For free-slip boundary conditions on the axial and radial velocity components, previous rigorous analysis for RBC implies that the azimuthal momentum transport in RPC is bounded from above by, where is the shear Reynolds number, with a scaling exponent smaller than the anticipated. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

It pressurizes the fluid to delay the onset of cavitation, which can adversely affect performance in a centrifugal pump. In this paper, the performance of a water pump inducer has been explored with and without the implementation of a stability control device (SCD). This device is an inlet cover bleed system that removes high-energy fluid near the blade leading edge and reinjects it back upstream. The research was conducted by running multiphase, time-accurate computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations at the design flow coefficient and at low, off-design flow coefficients. The suction performance and stability for the same inducer with and without the implementation of the SCD has been explored. An improvement in stability and suction performance was observed when the SCD was implemented. Without the SCD, the inducer developed backflow at the blade tip, which led to rotating cavitation and larger rotordynamic forces. With the SCD, no significant cavitation instabilities developed, and the rotordynamic forces remained small. The lack of cavitation instabilities also allowed the inducer to operate at lower inlet pressures, increasing the suction performance of the inducer.

Solar energy capture is modeled using the vehicle orientation and solar position, and energy isstored both in batteries and in potential energy through elevation gain. Energy capture is maximized by optimally adjusting the angle of the aircraft surface relative to the sun. The UAV flight and energy system dynamics are optimized over a 24h period at an 8s time resolution using nonlinear model predictive control.

Inhaled corticosteroid is a popular medication for treating chronic respiratory diseases. Its side effects include decreased bone mineral density and osteoporosis. The aims of this study are to investigate the association of inhaled corticosteroids and fracture and to design a clinical support system for fracture prediction. The data of patients aged 20 years and older, who had visited healthcare centers and been prescribed with inhaled corticosteroids within 2002-2010, were retrieved from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). After excluding patients diagnosed with hip fracture or vertebrate fractures before using inhaled corticosteroid, a total of 11645 patients receiving inhaled corticosteroid therapy were included for this study. Among them, 1134 (9.7%) were diagnosed with hip fracture or vertebrate fracture. The statistical results showed that demographic information, chronic respiratory diseases and comorbidities, and corticosteroid-related variables (cumulative dose, mean exposed daily dose, follow-up duration, and exposed duration) were significantly different between fracture and nonfracture patients. The clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) were designed with integrated genetic algorithm (GA) and support vector machine (SVM) by training and validating the models with balanced training sets obtained by random and cluster-based undersampling methods and testing with the imbalanced NHIRD dataset.

The predictive performance of the CDSSs exhibits a sensitivity of 69.84-77.00% and an AUC of 0.7495-0.7590.

This work explores the impact of a changing projected surface area and varying apparent radiative properties on the net radiative heat transfer of an accordion fold comprised of V-grooves. The net radiative heat transfer of an accordion tessellation is obtained by a thermal energy balance at the cavity openings with radiative properties of the cavities given as a function of various cavity parameters. Results of the analytical model are experimentally confirmed. An accordion tessellation, constructed of stainless-steel shim stock, is positioned to achieve a specified fold angle and placed in a vacuum environment while heated by Joule heating. A thermal camera records the apparent temperature of the cavity openings for various fold angles. Results are compared to apparent temperatures predicted with the analytical model. Analytically and experimentally obtained temperatures agree within 5% and all measurements fall within experimental uncertainty. For diffusely irradiated surfaces, the decrease in projected surface area dominates, causing a continuous decrease in net radiative heat transfer for a collapsing accordion fold. Highly reflective specular surfaces exposed to diffuse irradiation experience large turn-down ratios (7.5_ reduction in heat transfer) in the small angle ranges. Specular surfaces exposed to collimated irradiation achieve a turn down ratio of 3.35 between V-groove angles of 120 deg and 150 deg. The approach outlined here may be extended to modeling the net radiative heat transfer for other origami tessellations. © 2019 by ASME.",,Analytical models; Irradiation; Radiative transfer; Uncertainty analysis; Apparent temperature; Cavity parameters; Collimated irradiation; Experimental uncertainty; Irradiated surface; Radiative heat transfer; Radiative properties; Vacuum environment; Heat radiation,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061059937

This paper examines the impact of varying input pulse length on the accuracy of defect depth quantification as a function of the material properties. Simulations using both thermoplastics and metals show that measurement error is dependent on a nondimensionalized pulse length. The simulation results agree with experimental results for three-dimensional (3D) printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA) components. Analysis and experiments show that defects can be accurately detected with minor modification to the standard methods as long as the pulse ends before the characteristic defect signal is detected. © 2019 by ASME.",,3D printers; Polymer blends; Styrene; Surface defects; Surface testing; Thermography (imaging); Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; Defect depth quantifications; Non-destructive test methods; Nondestructive testing method; Pulse thermography; Subsurface defect; Surface temperatures; Threedimensional (3-d); Nondestructive examination,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062598705

Named equations tested include the Meyer-Peter Muller, Barry, Pagosa good condition, Wilcock, Parker (both calibrated and uncalibrated), Recking, and that of Elhakeem and Imran. The purpose of the tests was to evaluate the performance of several empirical and semiempirical formulae using a single calibration point relative to three uncalibrated equations. The seven equations were included because they either have a calibration procedure already developed, are used frequently in practice, are historically foundational in the field, or have recently been proposed. Results are expressed in the root mean square error of the logarithms (RMSEL) and the relative mean error (RME) and show that the Pagosa good and Barry equations best predict bedload sediment transport (RMSEL of 0.02 and 0.02, respectively). The Pagosa good equation requires a data point for bankfull discharge and the corresponding bedload transport. The uncalibrated Recking (2013) equation resulted in lower errors than two of the calibrated formulae (Wilcock 2001 and Parker 1990) and was not far behind the calibrated Elhakeem and Imran (2016) formula. The Meyer-Peter Muller and uncalibrated Parker (1990) equations performed the worst (RMSEL of up to 0.85 and 0.86, respectively). The results herein demonstrate: (1) empirical formulae were more successful at predicting bedload transport than semiempirical alternatives, (2) a single calibration point significantly improves the predictive accuracy of any formula, and (3) calibration cannot compensate for all the shortcomings of a model. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Calibration; Errors; Forecasting; Sediment transport; Sedimentation; Stream flow; Bankfull discharge; Bed-load transport rate; Bedload sediment transport; Calibration procedure; Gravel-bed streams; Predictive accuracy; Root mean square errors; Semi-empirical methods; Mean square error; bedload; calibration; comparative study; empirical analysis; gravel bed stream; prediction; sediment transport,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046279262

These dangerous countercurrents are known as submerged hydraulic jumps and are responsible for hundreds of fatalities at numerous low-head dams across the United States. The countercurrent creates high upstream-directed surface velocities across the width of the channel, making it nearly impossible for a trapped individual to escape. This submerged jump can occur for a range of upstream and downstream conditions. A multiple partial width deflector design for the downstream side of the dam was tested in the laboratory to determine effectiveness in completely or partially eliminating the submerged hydraulic jump. The results demonstrate that a dramatic reduction in upstream-directed surface velocities over a wide range of headwater and tailwater conditions is possible. The dam modification is relatively inexpensive, simple to install, and designed such that an individual will likely escape the submerged jump without severe injury or harm. The design is ready for prototype testing. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Hydraulic jump; Counter current; Head waters; Low-head dams; Partial widths; Prototype testing; Submerged hydraulic jumps; Surface velocity; Tailwater; Dams,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054509325

The process remains to be implemented on a wide scale in the automotive and aerospace industries, partially due to the relatively short number of welds producible by a toolset, prior to needing cleaning. In the following work, an investigation was conducted to better understand this limitation. First, the effective tool life of a steel toolset was quantified. Experiments showed that less than 60 consecutive welds could be made before the toolset seized and required cleaning. To better understand the conditions contributing so such a short tool life, thermocouples were used in subsequent experiments, to measure the temperatures achieved at various locations in the weld. Peak weld temperature increased with longer cycle times and decreased with shorter cycle times. During the experiments, it was noted that weld temperatures in excess of 500 ¡C were observed at weld center. At these high temperatures, the authors anticipate that intermetallic compounds (IMCs) are able to grow on tool surfaces. A rough, existing model of IMC growth in an Fe-Al system predicted IMC growth on the same order of magnitude of the tool clearances, supporting the anticipation that IMC growth is a factor in the observed, short tool life between cleanings. Following this analysis, future evaluation of less re-active tool materials is recommended. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",FSpW; Refill friction stir spot welding; RFSSW; Temperature; Tool life,Aerospace industry; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum coated steel; Automotive industry; Cleaning; Spot welding; Thermocouples; Tool steel; Welds; Effective tool; Friction stir spot welding; High temperature; Steel tools; Thin sheet; Tool materials; Tool surfaces; Weld temperature; Friction stir welding,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090035826

This could be explained by differences in surface energies between the different orientations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Crystallographic orientation; Hydrogen embrittlement; Recovery; Steel,Decay (organic); Hydrogen embrittlement; Recovery; Steel; Tensile testing; Advanced high strength steel; Concentration Measurement; Crystallographic orientations; Diffusible hydrogen; Empirical relations; Hydrogen concentration; Hydrogen diffusion; Microstructural evaluation; High strength steel,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054430682

Experimental bicrystals can be difficult or expensive to fabricate, and computational constraints limit atomistic bicrystal simulations to high-symmetry GBs (i.e., those with small enough GB periodicity). Although the use of bicrystal property data to construct GB structureÐproperty models is more direct, in many experimental situations the only type of data available may be measurements of the effective properties of polycrystals. In this work, we investigate the possibility of inferring GB structureÐproperty models from measurements of the homogenized effective properties of polycrystals when the form of the structureÐproperty model is unknown. We present an idealized case study in which GB structureÐproperty models for diffusivity are inferred from noisy simulation results of two-dimensional microstructures, under the assumption that the number of polycrystal measurements available is larger than the number of parameters in the inferred model. We also demonstrate how uncertainty quantification for the inferred structureÐproperty models is easily performed within this framework. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,Bicrystals; Grain boundaries; Polycrystals; Computational constraints; Effective property; Grain boundary structure; Measurements of; Property data; Property measurement; Property models; Uncertainty quantifications; Structural properties,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074606040

Healing feasibility was demonstrated by processing a tapered crack using a PCBN/W-Re tool with a 25 mm diameter shoulder and a pin length of 6.4 mm. The experiment showed that it was possible to heal a crack that begins narrow and then progressively grows up to a width of 2 mm. Bead on plate experiments were used to find the best parameters for creating a consolidated stir zone with the least amount of hardness difference compared to the base metal. Grain refinement in some specimens resulted in much higher stir zone hardness, compared to base metal. A plot of grain size versus microhardness showed a very strong inverse correlation between grain size and hardness, as expected from the Hall-Petch relationship. Corrosion testing was carried out in order to evaluate the effect of FSP on potential sensitization of the stir zone.

With the development of reliable welding tools and precise control systems, FSW of steels has reached a new level of technical maturity. High-quality, long welds can be produced in many engineering steels. Compared to traditional fusion welding, FSW exhibits unique advantages producing joints with better properties. As a result of active control of the welding temperature and/or cooling rate, FSW has the capability of fabricating steel joints with excellent toughness and strength. For example, unfavorable phase transformations that usually occur during traditional welding can be avoided and favorable phase fractions in advanced steels can be maintained in the weld zone thus avoiding the typical property degradations associated with fusion welding. If phase transformations do occur during FSW of thick steels, optimization of microstructure and properties can be attained by controlling the heat input and post-weld cooling rate. © 2017",Advanced high strength steels (AHSS); Carbon steels; High strength low alloy (HSLA) steels; Joining; Oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) steels; Stainless steels,Carbon steel; Cooling; Friction; High strength alloys; High strength steel; Joining; Microstructure; Phase transitions; Research laboratories; Stainless steel; Welds; Advanced high strength steel; Friction stir welding(FSW); High strength low alloy steels; Microstructure and properties; Microstructure control; Oxide dispersion strengthened steel; Typical properties; Welding temperatures; Friction stir welding,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85036524369

When conventional fusion welding is used for repair, intergranular cracks develop in the heat-affected zone (HAZ). Friction stir processing (FSP), which operates at much lower peak temperatures than fusion welding, was studied as a crack repair method for irradiated 304L stainless steel. A numerical simulation of the FSP process in 304L was developed to predict temperatures and recrystallized grain size in the stir zone. The model employed an Eulerian finite element approach, where flow stresses for a large range of strain rates and temperatures inherent in FSP were used as input. Temperature predictions in three locations near the stir zone were accurate to within 4%, while prediction of welding power was accurate to within 5% of experimental measurements. The predicted recrystallized grain sizes ranged from 7.6 to 10.6 _m, while the experimentally measured grains sizes in the same locations ranged from 6.0 to 7.6 _m.

In this paper, we show the extent to which different social impacts in 11 impact categories are co-present in 150 products and how this can help engineers and others during the product development process. Specifically, we show how social impact categories not previously considered can be identified. The product review resulted in 13,200 data points that were divided into two data sets, one with 8800 data points from which a social impact probability table was created. The remaining data points were then used to validate the table. All data points were then combined to create a final social impact probability table. This table provides insight for how various social impact categories correlate and can assist engineers in expanding their views to include additional social impact objectives and thus achieve a design with broader social impact or a design with minimized unwanted negative social impact. A simple method for predicting social impact is also created in order to assist engineers when developing products with social impacts in mind. © 2019 by ASME.",Design for humans; Design for X; Product development; Sustainable design,Developing countries; Engineers; Product development; Developing product; Developing world; Engineered products; New product development; Probability tables; Product development process; Product reviews; SIMPLE method; Economic and social effects,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088392505

This paper explores current practices in industries used by design engineers to consider the social impact of products. Forty-six individuals from 34 different companies were interviewed to discover what disconnects exist between academia and industry when considering a product's social impact. These interviews were also used to discover how social impact might be considered in a design setting moving forward. This is not a study to find Òthe state of the art,Ó but considers the average engineering professional's work to design products in various industries. Social impact assessments (SIA) and social life cycle assessments (SLCA) are two of the most common processes discussed in the literature to evaluate social impact, both generally and in products. Interestingly, these processes did not arise in any discussion in interviews, despite respondents affirming that they do consider social impact in the product design. Processes used to predict social impact, rather than simply evaluate, were discussed by the respondents. These tended to be developed within the company and often related to industry imposed government regulations. To build on this study, the findings herein should be further validated for executives, managers, and engineers. A study specific to these roles should be designed to understand the disconnect better. Additionally, processes should be developed to assist engineers in considering the social impact of their products. Work should also be done to help educate engineers and their leaders on the value of considering the social impact in product design.

Currently, there is no standard method for measuring the social impact of these types of products. As a result, engineers have used their own metrics, if at all. Some of the common metrics used include products sold and revenue, which measure the financial success of a product without recognizing the social successes or failures it might have. In this paper, we introduce a potential universal metric, the product impact metric (PIM), which quantifies the impact a product has on impoverished individuals - especially those living in developing countries. It measures social impact broadly in five dimensions: health, education, standard of living, employment quality, and security. By measuring impact multidimensionally, it captures impacts both anticipated and unanticipated, thereby providing a broader assessment of the product's total impact than with other more specific metrics. The PIM is calculated based on 18 simple field measurements of the consumer. It is inspired by the UN's Multidimensional Poverty Index (UNMPI) created by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The UNMPI measures how level of poverty within a nation changes year after year, and the PIM measures how an individual's poverty level changes after being affected by an engineered product. The PIM can be used to measure social impact (using specific data from products introduced into the market) or predict social impact (using personas that represent real individuals).

Some social impacts are commonly recognized by the engineering community, such as impacts to a user's health and safety, while other social impacts can be more difficult to recognize, such as impacts on families and gender roles. When engineers make design decisions, without considering social impacts, they can unknowingly cause negative social impacts. Even harming the user and/or society. Despite its challenges, measuring a program's or policy's social impact is a common practice in the field of social sciences. These measurements are made using social impact indicators, which are simply the things observed to verify that true progress is being made. While there are clear benefits to predicting the social impact of an engineered product, it is unclear how engineers should select indicators and build predictive social impact models that are functions of engineering parameters and decisions. This paper introduces a method for selecting social impact indicators and creating predictive social impact models that can help engineers predict and improve the social impact of their products. As a first step in the method, an engineer identifies the product's users, objectives, and requirements. Then, the social impact categories that are related to the product are determined. From each of these categories, the engineer selects several social impact indicators. Finally, models are created for each indicator to predict how a product's parameters will change these indicators. The impact categories and indicators can be translated into product requirements and performance measures that can be used in product development processes. This method is used to predict the social impact of the proposed, expanded U.S. Mexico border wall. © 2019 Copernicus GmbH.

Net present value (NPV) analyses of several real world applications are examined from the perspective of manufacturers (i.e., defense contractors, automobile, pharmaceutical, and microprocessor manufactures) and customers (i.e., purchases of vehicles, televisions, cell phones, washing machines, and buildings). This analysis is used to determine the conditions under which an over-design approach provides a greater benefit than a redesign approach. Over-design is found to have a higher NPV than redesign when future requirements occur soon after the initial release, discount rates are low, initial research, and development cost or price is high, and when the incremental costs of the future requirements are low. © 2019 by ASME.",capabilities; excess; Over-design; redesign; requirements,Automobile manufacture; Cellular telephones; Obsolescence; Purchasing; capabilities; Defense contractor; Development costs; excess; Net present value; Product development strategy; redesign; requirements; Product design,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059899608

Lamina emergent compliant mechanisms often exhibit undesirable parasitic motions due to the planar fabrication constraint. This work introduces a type of lamina emergent torsion (LET) joint that reduces parasitic motions of lamina emergent mechanisms, and presents equations for modeling parasitic motion of LET joints. The membrane joint also makes possible one-way joints that can ensure origami-based mechanisms emerge from their flat state (a change point) into the desired configuration. Membrane-enhanced LET (M-LET) joints, including one-way surrogate folds, are described here and show promise for use in a wide range of compliant mechanisms and origami-based compliant mechanisms.

These conditions make it highly impractical to collaborate locally around physical models. Various approaches to creating new collaboration tools and software, which alleviate these issues, have been tried previously. However, past solutions either used expensive hardware, which is not widely available, or used standard two-dimensional (2D) monitors to share three-dimensional (3D) information. Recently, new low-cost virtual reality (VR) hardware has been introduced, which creates a highly immersive 3D experience at a tiny fraction of the cost of previous hardware.

Gyrostabilization is a potential option, but we do not currently know how to optimize gyrostabilization for tremor suppression. To address this gap, we present a systematic investigation of how gyrostabilizer parameters affect tremor suppression in a single degree of freedom (DOF). A simple model with a single DOF at the wrist and a gyroscope mounted on the back of the hand was used to focus on the most basic effects. We simulated the frequency response of the system (hand + gyroscope) to a tremorogenic input torque at the wrist. Varying system parameters one at a time, we determined the effect of individual parameters on the system's frequency response. To minimize the bandwidth without adding significant inertia, the inertia and spin speed of the flywheel should be as high as design constraints allow, whereas the distance from the wrist joint axis to the gyroscope and the precession stiffness and damping should be kept as low as possible. The results demonstrate the potential of gyroscopic tremor suppression and can serve as foundation for further investigations of gyroscopic tremor suppression in the upper limb. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.",gyroscope; gyrostabilizer; hand; suppression; Tremor; wrist,Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Frequency response; Technology transfer; gyrostabilizer; hand; suppression; Tremor; wrist; Gyroscopes,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067179115

To address this gap, we present a systematic investigation of how gyrostabilizer parameters affect tremor suppression in a single degree of freedom (DOF). A simple model with a single DOF at the wrist and a gyroscope mounted on the back of the hand was used to focus on the most basic effects. We simulated the frequency response of the system (hand + gyroscope) to a tremorogenic input torque at the wrist. Varying system parameters one at a time, we determined the effect of individual parameters on the system's frequency response. To minimize the bandwidth without adding significant inertia, the inertia and spin speed of the flywheel should be as high as design constraints allow, whereas the distance from the wrist joint axis to the gyroscope and the precession stiffness and damping should be kept as low as possible. The results demonstrate the potential of gyroscopic tremor suppression and can serve as foundation for further investigations of gyroscopic tremor suppression in the upper limb. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.",gyroscope; gyrostabilizer; hand; suppression; Tremor; wrist,Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Frequency response; Technology transfer; gyrostabilizer; hand; suppression; Tremor; wrist; Gyroscopes,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067179115

First, a dynamic stiffness matrix of the flexible beam is deduced, which has the same definition and a similar form as the traditional static compliance/stiffness matrix but is frequency dependent. Second, the pseudo-static modeling procedure for the dynamic analysis is implemented in a statics-similar way based on D'alembert's principle. Then, all the kinematic, static and dynamic performances of compliant mechanisms can be analyzed based on the pseudo-static model. The superiority of the proposed method is that when it is used for the dynamic modeling of compliant mechanisms, the traditional dynamic modeling procedures, such as calculation of the elastic and kinetic energies as well as using Lagrange's equation, are avoided and the dynamic modeling is converted to a staticssimilar problem. Comparison of the proposed method with an elastic-beam-based model in previous literature and finite element analysis for an exemplary XY precision positioning stage reveals its high accuracy and easy operation. © 2018 by ASME.",Compliant mechanisms,Dynamics; Flexible structures; Frequency domain analysis; Kinetic energy; Mechanisms; Stiffness matrix; D' Alembert's principle; Dynamic stiffness matrix; Frequency dependent; Frequency domains; Lagrange's equation; Modeling procedure; Precision positioning stage; Static and dynamic performance; Compliant mechanisms,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048460195

The CMOS/PDMS layer is self-aligned to form a continuous, flat surface to provide structural support for upper microfluidic layers. The system consists of five layers of PDMS implementing fluid channels, valves, chambers, and inlets/outlets. A custom CMOS image sensor with integrated signal conditioning circuits directly captures light from sample fluid for high optical collection efficiency. Owing to the flexibility afforded by the integration process, the system demonstrates, for the first time, integrated valves in contact imaging. Moreover, we present the first direct comparison of the optical performance of a CMOS image sensor and a photomultiplier tube (PMT) in identical contact-imaging conditions. Measurements show that our CMOS sensor achieves 17 dB better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with a commercial PMT across a broad range of integration times, with a maximum SNR of 47 dB.

Because these devices can include complicated topography, many existing methods for depositing antireflective layers are difficult, impractical, or unusable. Aim: To create a light-blocking antireflective layer that works well with complicated MEMS and sensor devices, a layer should be made that is cheap, simple, and can be deposited and patterned with high resolution at low temperatures. Approach: Light blocking is achieved using an aluminum layer. Suppressing reflection is achieved by mixing aluminum oxide nanoparticles in photoresist to create a layer that partially absorbs and partially scatters light. Results: The combination of a layer of metal and a layer of nanoparticles and photoresist completely blocks transmission of light and significantly reduces reflections across the visible spectrum, particularly for shorter wavelengths. The layer is also patternable to sizes as small as a few microns with high resolution. Conclusion: By combining a metal layer and a layer of nanoparticles in photoresist, a simple, cheap, and effective light-blocking antireflective layer can be created that is compatible with planar devices with complex topography. © 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",lithography; optics; photonics,Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Light; Light reflection; Lithography; Metal nanoparticles; Optics; Photonics; Photoresists; Plasma diagnostics; Aluminum oxide nanoparticles; Anti-reflective layers; Complex topographies; Complicated topographies; High-resolution patterning; Nanoparticle suspension; Optical sensor devices; Reflection of light; Light transmission,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062638342

The system embeds the CMOS image sensor directly in a PDMS layer instead of the standard chip package to support microfluidic structures much larger and more complex than those in prior art. The CMOS/PDMS layer is self-aligned to form a continuous, flat surface to provide structural support for upper microfluidic layers. The system consists of five layers of PDMS implementing fluid channels, valves, chambers, and inlets/outlets. A custom CMOS image sensor with integrated signal conditioning circuits directly captures light from sample fluid for high optical collection efficiency. Owing to the flexibility afforded by the integration process, the system demonstrates, for the first time, integrated valves in contact imaging. Moreover, we present the first direct comparison of the optical performance of a CMOS image sensor and a photomultiplier tube (PMT) in identical contact-imaging conditions. Measurements show that our CMOS sensor achieves 17 dB better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with a commercial PMT across a broad range of integration times, with a maximum SNR of 47 dB.

Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of high resolution separation of gases in a benchtopscale short column system by controlling thermal gradients through the column. This work reports a microfabricated thermally controllable gas chromatographic column with a small footprint (approximately 6.25 cm2). The design of the 20 cm column utilizes 21 individually controllable thin film heaters and conduction cooling to produce a desired temperature profile. The reported device is capable of heating and cooling rates exceeding 8000 ¡C/min and can reach temperatures of 350 ¡C. The control methods allow for excellent disturbance rejection and precision to within +/- 1 ¡C. Each length of the column between heaters was demonstrated to be individually controllable and displayed quadratic temperature profiles. This paper focuses on the fabrication process and implementation of the thermal control strategy.

This is due to their low inertia and inherent ability to more safely interact with the world without damaging themselves or the people around them. However, existing sensing for soft robots has at least partially limited their ability to control interactions with their environment. Tactile sensors could enable soft robots to sense interaction, but most tactile sensors are made from rigid substrates and are not well suited to applications for soft robots which can deform. In addition, the benefit of being able to cheaply manufacture soft robots may be lost if the tactile sensors that cover them are expensive and their resolution does not scale well for manufacturability. This paper discusses the development of a method to make affordable, high-resolution, tactile sensor arrays (manufactured in rows and columns) that can be used for sensorizing soft robots and other soft bodies. However, the construction results in a sensor array that exhibits significant amounts of cross-talk when two taxels in the same row are compressed. Using the same fabric-based tactile sensor array construction design, two different methods for cross-talk compensation are presented. The first uses a mathematical model to calculate a change in resistance of each taxel directly. The second method introduces additional simple circuit components that enable us to isolate each taxel electrically and relate voltage to force directly.

Among a variety of reported nanomaterials for biomedical applications, metal and metal oxide-based nanoparticles offer unique physicochemical properties allowing their use in combination with conventional antimicrobials and as magnetic field-controlled drug delivery nanocarriers. An ever-growing number of studies demonstrate that by combining magnetic nanoparticles with membrane-active, natural human cathelicidin-derived LL-37 peptide, and its synthetic mimics such as ceragenins, innovative nanoagents might be developed. Between others, they demonstrate high clinical potential as antimicrobial, anti-cancer, immunomodulatory and regenerative agents.

The apparatus developed in this research included an impactor unit, a moving platform, a microphone for air-coupled sensing, a distance measurement instrument, and signal processing modules. Given the absence of an existing universal threshold for differentiating among intact and delaminated areas using the new device, a delamination detection threshold value was determined in a first field demonstration also involving chain dragging and coring of a concrete bridge deck. While the maps of the air-coupled impact-echo data and chain-dragging data exhibit a high degree of similarity and are highly consistent with the results of coring, a quantitative method of comparison also demonstrates the utility of the new device across a broad range of delamination percentages. Specifically, the results indicate that the percentage of the deck area determined to be delaminated using impact-echo testing was within 3 percentage points of that determined to be delaminated using chain dragging for 10 of the 13 deck test sections, which generally exhibited delamination percentages ranging from 7 to 21%. Finally, testing with the new device was more than seven times faster than chain dragging. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Air-coupled impact-echo testing; Chain dragging; Concrete bridge deck; Delamination,Bridge decks; Concrete testing; Concretes; Delamination; Signal processing; Degree of similarity; Delamination detections; Excitation mechanisms; Impact-echo testing; Measurement instruments; Percentage points; Quantitative method; Universal threshold; Concrete bridges,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062617729

Of all the components of a bridge, the bridge deck typically deteriorates most quickly and must therefore be regularly inspected for non-visible internal cracking, called delamination, for which early detection and repair can enhance safety and performance as well as reduce long-term maintenance costs. This research demonstrates the development and deployment of a multi-channel acoustic impact-echo sounding apparatus equipped with specially-configured tire chains for acoustic excitation of the concrete, microphones, an array of sensors for establishing spatial position estimates, and a data processing architecture for accurately detecting and mapping delaminations in concrete bridge decks at high speeds.

For infusion under a flexible membrane, such as vacuum infusion, or for simulation of a part with non-uniform thickness, one must test the permeability at various levels of compaction. This process is time consuming and often relies on interpolation or extrapolation around a few experimental permeability measurements. To accelerate the process of permeability characterization, a small number of methodologies have been previously presented in the literature, in which the permeability may be tested at multiple fiber volume contents in a single test. Some of the methods even measure the permeability over a continuous range of thicknesses, thus requiring no later interpolation of permeability values. A novel method is presented here for the rapid measurement of permeability over a continuous range of fiber volume content, in a single unidirectional vacuum infusion flow experiment. The thickness gradient across the vacuum bag, as well as the fluid pressure at several locations in the mold were concurrently measured to calculate the fabric compressibility. An analytical flow model, which accounts for the compressibility, is then used by iterating the fitting constant in a permeability model until the predicted flow front progression matches empirical measurement. The method is demonstrated here for two reinforcement materials: (1) a fiberglass unbalanced weave and (2) a carbon biax non-crimped fabric. The standard deviation across the multiple experiments for each material and flow orientation ranged from 12.8% to 29.7%. Validation of these results was performed by comparing the resulting permeability with multiple non-continuous permeability measurement methods. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",liquid composite molding; Permeability; vacuum infusion,Carbon; Compressibility; Interpolation; Mechanical permeability; Molding; Optimization; Reinforcement; Empirical measurement; Fiber volume content; Liquid composite molding; Non-uniform thickness; Permeability measurements; Reinforcement materials; Thickness gradients; Vacuum infusion; Characterization,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032700813

Identical introductory, non-majors biology classes were manipulated at both a public, open-enrollment institution and a private, highly selective institution. We found that video lectures offer a small advantage to overall student learning over interactive tutorials or textbook-style readings.

The capsule moves and is deformed by the action of a pulsatile flow inside the tube with a non-null mean velocity. This configuration can be found in the nature and in many bioengineering systems where artificial capsules are driven by micro-pumps through micro-channels. The capsule is considered as a thin hyperelastic membrane, which encloses an internal fluid. As it has been demonstrated in the literature, this model represents a wide range of artificial capsules, for example, the alginate-based capsules, typically used in bioengineering applications. A hybrid isogeometric finite element method and boundary element method based on a T-spline discretization and formulated in the time domain is used to solve the mechanical and hydrodynamical equations. The influence of the relative rigidity of the membrane, frequency and amplitude of the pulsatile flow is studied. Results show that the behavior of the capsule differs from steady flows and it depends strongly on the frequency of the flow and mechanical characteristic of the capsule. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Deformable capsule; IGA; Pulsatile flow; T-spline,Boundary element method; Deformation; Pulsatile flow; Sailing vessels; Splines; Deformable capsule; Discretizations; Hydrodynamical equations; Hyperelastic membranes; Mean velocities; Mechanical characteristics; Relative rigidity; T-splines; Time domain analysis; alginic acid; Article; bioengineering; dynamics; microcapsule; oscillation; priority journal; pulsatile flow; rigidity; surface area; surface property; velocity; hydrodynamics; mechanics; microcapsule; Capsules; Hydrodynamics; Mechanical Phenomena; Pulsatile Flow,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056570718

In XPS, photoelectrons are generated by irradiating a surface with x rays. As the importance and popularity of XPS have grown, it has drawn users without significant XPS experience, and incorrect and incomplete interpretations of XPS spectra regularly appear in the literature. This tutorial is designed as a tool to guide less experienced users in analyzing XPS survey spectra. Here, the authors examine a series of XPS survey spectra collected during the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 from trimethylaluminum and water precursors. Prior to this, brief explanations of XPS and ALD are presented. This tutorial is structured as a series of questions and answers that the interested reader may choose to engage in. The XPS spectra are scrutinized to extract information about the elements present in the film, the presence of contamination, and the nature of the film growth process. The questions and answers in this tutorial address important fundamental issues common to the interpretation of many XPS survey spectra in the context of ALD. © 2018 Author(s).",,Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Atomic layer deposition; Film growth; Photoelectrons; Photons; Silicon; Surveys; Extract informations; Growth process; Trimethylaluminum; XPS spectra; XPS survey; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056339420

Using algal-bacterial systems helps to reach a cost-efficient treatment method by eliminating mechanical aeration, since algae produce the oxygen needed for treatment process. In this study, two groups of experiments were performed for domestic wastewater treatment processes. For the first group, semi-continuous microalgae-bacterial photo-bioreactors were cultivated. Chlorella Vulgaris and activated sludge (AS) were used as microalgae and bacterial inoculums, respectively. The effect of different algae and AS ratios on the chemical oxygen demand (COD), N-NH4 + and P-PO4 3_ removal was studied. The removal efficiency of COD was above 93 % for the three tested algae and AS inoculum ratios (5:1, 1:1, and 1:5). The reactor with algae: AS inoculum ratio of 5:1 achieved the highest final N-NH4 + and P-PO4 3_ removal efficiencies (88.0 ± 1.0 % and 84.0 ± 1.0 %, respectively). Furthermore, the highest biomass concentration (1.96 g L-1 from initial amount of 0.3 g L-1) was observed in the reactor with algae: AS ratio of 5:1.

Using algal-bacterial systems helps to reach a cost-efficient treatment method by eliminating mechanical aeration, since algae produce the oxygen needed for treatment process. In this study, two groups of experiments were performed for domestic wastewater treatment processes. For the first group, semi-continuous microalgae-bacterial photo-bioreactors were cultivated. Chlorella Vulgaris and activated sludge (AS) were used as microalgae and bacterial inoculums, respectively. The effect of different algae and AS ratios on the chemical oxygen demand (COD), N-NH4 + and P-PO4 3_ removal was studied. The removal efficiency of COD was above 93 % for the three tested algae and AS inoculum ratios (5:1, 1:1, and 1:5). The reactor with algae: AS inoculum ratio of 5:1 achieved the highest final N-NH4 + and P-PO4 3_ removal efficiencies (88.0 ± 1.0 % and 84.0 ± 1.0 %, respectively). Furthermore, the highest biomass concentration (1.96 g L-1 from initial amount of 0.3 g L-1) was observed in the reactor with algae: AS ratio of 5:1. The ratio of 5:1 (algae: AS) was found as the optimum ratio which promoted the cooperation between microalgae and AS for nutrient removal. For the second group of experiments, the optimum ratio of 5:1 (algae: AS) was used in a membrane bioreactor, and the results showed that this reactor enhanced the final removal efficacies from 88 to 98 % and from 84 to 89 % for N-NH4 + and P-PO4 3-, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Algal-bacterial culture; Membrane bioreactor; Microalgae; Photo-bioreactor; Wastewater treatment,,Journal,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083197890

Peak radiated noise levels correlate with the time when the valve opens and closes, while the noise levels when the valve is completely open are also relatively high. Significant noise ranges between 300 Hz and 3000 Hz. It was hypothesized that increasing the in-tube distance between the flush valve and the bowl in addition to increasing the bend radius of the tube would reduce radiated noise levels. These modifications resulted in a reduction of about 14 dB in the radiated noise during the valve opening and closing in addition to a reduction of about 5 dB while the valve is completely opened. Intermediate results of varying the tube length and bend radius are presented to show their effects on the radiated sound levels.

The approach is based on rank aggregation, which meaningfully utilizes the correlation among the relevance ranks of predictor variables given by three state-of-the-art feature selectors: Relief-F, minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR), and maximum likelihood feature selection (MLFS). By applying the SVM combined with MVFS on a self-created dataset containing maximal and submaximal exercise data from 185 college students, several new hybrid VO2max prediction models have been created. To compare the performance of the proposed ensemble approach on prediction of VO2max, SVM-based models with individual combinations of Relief-F, mRMR, and MLFS as well as with other alternative ensemble feature selectors from the literature have also been developed. The results reveal that MVFS outperforms other individual and ensemble feature selectors and yields up to 8.76% increment and 11.15% decrement rates in multiple correlation coefficients (Rs) and root mean square errors (RMSEs), respectively. Furthermore, in addition to reconfirming the relevance of sex, age, and maximal heart rate in predicting VO2max, which were previously reported in the literature, it is revealed that submaximal heart rates and exercise times at 1.5-mile distance are two further discriminative predictors of VO2max. The results have also been compared to those obtained by a general regression neural network and single decision tree combined with MVFS, and it is shown that the SVM exhibits much better performance than other methods for prediction of VO2max. © TB_TAK",Ensemble feature selection; Maximal oxygen uptake; Prediction; Rank aggregation; Support vector machine,Decision trees; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Heart; Maximum likelihood; Mean square error; Neural networks; Students; Ensemble feature selections; General regression neural network; Maximal oxygen uptake; Minimum redundancy-maximum relevances; Multiple correlation coefficients; Predictor variables; Rank aggregation; Root mean square errors; Support vector machines,Journal,Final,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072612849
